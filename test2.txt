Codification (law)
In law, codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction. They are listed, usually by subject, forming a legal code (a codex or book of law). Codification is the defining feature of civil law jurisdictions. ==History== Ancient Sumer's Code of Ur-Nammu was compiled 2100-2050 BC. It is the earliest known surviving civil code. Three centuries later, the Babylonian king Hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him. Religious laws such as the Torah were codified. Important codifications were developed in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the Lex Duodecim Tabularum. Much later the Corpus Iuris Civilis was assembled. These codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule. During much of ancient history the Roman laws were left mostly uncodified. The first permanent system of codified laws could be found in China. This was with the compilation of the Tang Code in AD 624. This formed the basis of the Chinese criminal code. This was then replaced by the Great Qing Legal Code. This code was in turn abolished in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China. The new laws of the Republic of China were inspired by the German codified work, the Burgerliches Gesetzbuch.Chinese law A very influential example in Europe was the French Napoleonic code of 1804. Another early system of laws is Hindu law framed by Manu and called as Manu Smriti. They date back to the 2nd century BC. The use of civil codes in Islamic Sharia law began with the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century AD. ==References== Category:Legal terms Category:International law

Cosmological principle
In modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is a prediction based on the idea that the universe is about the same in all places when viewed on a large scale. Forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe. There should, therefore, be no observable irregularities in the large scale structure. The structure is the result of the evolution of the matter field after the Big Bang. Astronomer William Keel explains: > The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a > sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for > all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that > the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the > same physical laws apply throughout.. p. 2. The two testable consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout"). The principles are closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous. == References == Category:Cosmology

Elastin
thumb|Elastin derived from cow aorta Elastin is part of connective tissue. It is an elastic protein which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored. Elastin is important in blood vessels because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, ligaments, the skin, the bladder, and elastic cartilage. It is present in all vertebrates above the jawless fish. In humans, elastin is encoded by the ELN gene. == References == Category:Animal tissues

Afar Triangle
thumb|330px|right|Topographic map showing the Afar Triangle, which correlates to the shaded area in the location map shown above The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia. == Human fossils == Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans. Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna. == Geography == The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level. The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth. The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map. === Plate tectonics === The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt. The continuous process of volcanism makes mineral deposits, like sulfur, salt, bentonite, and gypsum. There are also geothermal energy sources and hot springs in different areas of the region. In 2005, a giant rift was formed in just a few days.Giant Crack In Africa, New Scientist, November 4, 2009 The rift opened when the Dabbahu Volcano erupted. The rift is part of the process of the Arabian and African plates moving apart. This new crack, long, and deep, opened when the lava from the erupting volcano flowed underground and cooled. It left a long, wide dike within days. == References == Category:East Africa Category:Archaeological sites in Africa
Chain mail
thumb|right|228px| Mail, or chain mail,"chain mail" Cambridge dictionaries online is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour.Hazel Richardson, Life of the Ancient Celts (New York: Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), p. 28 Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest. ==Etymology== The origins* of the word "mail" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word macula, meaning "spot" or "opacity"."mail, n.3". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. Another theory relates the word to the Old French "maillier", meaning "to hammer" (related to the modern English word "malleable"). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders. *Another possible source is Italian. The word for jersey or sweater, and sometimes shirt, in modern Italian is maglia or, in French, maillot. == History == Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC.Richard A. Gabriel, The Great Armies of Antiquity (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002), p. 21 At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe.Richard A. Gabriel, The Ancient World (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006), p. 79 The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead.Encyclopedia of Military Science, ed. G. Kurt Piehler (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2013). p. 270 Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship.Ballistic Materials and Penetration Mechanics, ed. Roy Laible (Amsterdam; New York: Elsevier Scientific Pub. Co., 1980), p. 16 Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century.Michele Byam, Arms and Armor (New York, NY: DK Publishers, 2011), p. 24 == Modern uses == Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters.Gavriel Salvendy, Handbook of Human Factors and Ergonomics (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2012), p. 904 Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks.Catherine Veitch, A Daredevil's Guide to Swimming with Sharks (North Mankato, MN: Capstone Press, 2013), p. 25 But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors.Michael A. Cramer, Medieval Fantasy as Performance: The Society for Creative Anachronism and the Current Middle Ages (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2010). p. 123 It is also popular in live action role playing.Lizzie Stark, Leaving Mundania: Inside the Transformative World of Live Action Role-Playing Games (Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2012), p. 113 == Gallery == File:Verschiedene Kettenhemden.jpg|.

Triatominae
The members of Triatominae are a subfamily of Reduviidae. They are also called kissing bugs, conenose bugs, assassin bugs or triatomines. There are more than 130 species in this subfamily. Most of them feed on vertebrate blood. A few species feed on other invertebrates. They are mainly found in the Americas. There are a few species in Asia, Australia and Africa.

Junagadh State
Junagadh was a princely state in Gujarat ruled by Muslim rulers in British India until it became part of India in 1948.Richard N. Rosecrance; Arthur A. Stein, No More States?: Globalization, National Self-determination, and Terrorism (Lanham, Md: Rowman & Littlefield, 2006), p. 147 ==History== Mohammad Sher Khan Babi, a Babi Khel Pathan who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh. It declared independence in 1730 after the Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher Khan Babi, was the founder of the Babi Dynasty of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, took large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries. First they were a tributary state of Marathas. Later they were under the rule of the British Raj. In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate. The East India Company took control of the state by 1818. The Saurashtra area, with other princely states of Kathiawar, were separately administered under Kathiawar Agency by British India. On 15 August 1947 upon the independence of India, the Nawab of Junagarh decided to merge it into newly formed Pakistan. The Indian government maintained the people of Junagadh should decide. Pakistan waited until 13 September to respond saying they accepted Junagarh's acceptance of Pakistani rule. This caused a general revolt among the Hindu majority of Junagadh as well as protest movements in the surrounding states that had acceded to join India. The Nawab then occupied territory in several of those states claiming he had rule over them. When the Indian government sent a small force to restore order, the Nawab fled to Pakistan. His Dewan (Prime minister) agreed to rule by India. This resulted in the integration of Junagadh into India.Gandhi, Rajmohan (1991). Patel: A Life. India: Navajivan. p. 292. ===Rulers=== The Nawabs of Junagadh belonged to Pathan Babi khel tribe. They were granted a 13 gun salute by the British authorities: * 1730 - 1758 : Mohammad Bahadur Khanji or Mohammad Sher Khan BabiNawabs of Junagadh British Library. * 1758 - 1774 : Mohammad Mahabat Khanji I * 1774 - 1811 : Mohammad Hamid Khanji I * 1811 - 1840 : Mohammad Bahadur Khanji I * 1840 - 1851 : Mohammad Hamid Khanji II * 1851 - 1882 : Mohammad Mahabat Khanji II * 1882 - 1892 : Mohammad Bahadur Khanji II * 1892 - 1911 : Mohammad Rasul Khanji * 1911 - 1948 : Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III (last de facto ruler) {| |- valign="top" |200px|thumb| Junagadh Nawabs and state officials, 19th century. |thumb|200px|Mohammad Mahabat Khanji II, the Nawab of Junagarh, with young, Mohammad Bahadur Khanji III. 1870s. |200px|thumb|Bahadur Khanji III (r. 1882-1892), Nawab of Junagadh, and state officials, 1880s. |200px|thumb|Mohammad Rasul Khanji, Nawab of Junagadh, Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai, Wazier, Junagadh, 1890s. |} == Dispute == Many in Pakistan still maintains the 1948 plebiscite and rule by India was an illegitimate action. One of the reasons is because Kashmir at the time was ruled by a Hindu but had a clear Muslim majority. By acceding to India it was the opposite of the situation in Junagadh. For its part India knew Junagadh was the premier state in the western Kathiawar region. It was bound on three sides by states that acceded to India. On the fourth side was bounded by the Arabian Sea. This gave it great strategic importance to both countries. India was not prepared to accept Junagadh's acceding to Pakistan. This would create a Pakistan state in the middle of Indian states. India's taking administrative control of Junagadh to restore order is seen as a pretext by Pakistan. The referendum taken by the people of Junagadh, under the control of the Indian army, was overwhelmingly in favor of Indian rule. Pakistan has never accepted this vote by the people there and believes Junagadh rightly belongs to them. === Pakistan's legitimacy claim === Pakistan's government has maintained its territorial claim on Junagadh, along with Manavadar and Sir Creek in Gujarat, on its official political map issued on 4th August 2020. ==References== == Other websites == *Official Website of State of Junagadh *Classic Gallery of Indian Numismatics *Heraldry of the princely states of Gujarat Category:Territorial disputes Category:Gujarat Category:History of India Category:History of Pakistan Category:Indian princely states Category:Territorial disputes of Pakistan Category:1730 establishments Category:1948 disestablishments in India Category:1730s establishments in Asia Category:18th-century establishments in India
Nordertor
The Nordertor (Danish: Norreport) is an old town gate of the city of Flensburg. The gate was built around 1595. Today, the little landmark is in use as a symbol for the German town Flensburg.Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: Flensburg, 29 == History == In 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its town wall. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called Norder Porte. It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor.Werner Scharnweber: Flensburg, 29 This marked the northern boundary of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night.Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: Flensburg, Glossary: Nordertor On the north side of the gate are two plaques. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King Christian IV, 1577-1648 and the Latin words: ,,Regna Firmat Pietas" -- Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the German words: ,,Friede ernahrt, Unfrieden verzehrt" -- Peace nurtures, strife devours. There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was restored in the time of Christian VII, 1749-1808.Compare Flensburger Strassennamen. Gesellschaft fur Flensburger Stadtgeschichte, Flensburg 2005 , , article: Am Nordertor After 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall. There had been a ban on building outside the wall before then.Flensburger Tageblatt: Engelsby, Murwik, Jurgensby - Stadtgeschichte vor der Haustur, Februar 5. 2009. Retrieved November 28, 2015. The Neustadt (Newtown), in the neighborhood of the Nordertor was built. In 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect Paul Ziegler. The Nordertor got a clock.Lutz Wilde: Denkmaltopographie Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Kulturdenkmale in Schleswig-Holstein. Band 2, Flensburg, page 140 In 1966 the Deutsche Bundespost made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it. It was a 30 Pfennig stamp, used to send letters within Germany. The Nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times.Flensburg- Online, Nordertor, Retrieved November 28, 2015 In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings, so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate.

Ship's cat
A ship's cat is a cat that rides along on a ship. Ship's cats have been very popular in history, and date back to ancient times. Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons - most importantly, to catch mice and rats. On a ship, these rodents can damage ropes and wooden parts of the ship. Once electricity was discovered, rodents would also damage ships' electrical wiring. Also, rodents threatened the ship's cargo - the things it carried. Rodents would eat the food carried to feed the crew. If the ship was carrying things like grain as part of its cargo, rodents could also cause the ship to lose money by eating the cargo. Also, rats and mice spread disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. For example, rat fleas can carry plague, and rats on ships may have been one of the main reasons why the Black Death spread. Cats naturally attack and kill these rodents. Cats also have a natural ability to get used to new surroundings, so they could get used to serving on ships. They also offered companionship (friendship), a sense of home and security, and lifted sailors' spirits. This was helpful to sailors who could be away from home for long periods, especially in times of war. ==Early history== Cats were probably domesticated about 9,500 years ago. Not long after that, people began taking cats aboard boats and ships. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board Nile boats to catch birds in the thickets along the riverbanks.. The ancient Egyptians also carried cats on trading ships to control rodents. Traders from other areas soon started doing the same thing. This led to the spread of cats throughout the world. Cats eventually reached nearly all parts of the world that could be reached by ship. Phoenician cargo ships are thought to have brought the first domesticated cats to Europe in about 900 BC. ==Cats and superstition== Cats in Ancient Egypt were worshipped as deities (powerful spirits). For many centuries, cats have had a reputation as magical animals. Many sailors believed myths and superstitions about cats.Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions. A&C; Black, London, UK. . Cats were thought of as smart, lucky animals. Sailors usually took very good care of their ship's cats to keep them happy. Some sailors believed that six-toed cats were better at catching pests. They may have thought that extra toes give a cat better balance, which would be important when at sea. In some places, all six-toed cats became known as "ship's cats". Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too. They believed that these cats would use their special powers to protect their husbands at sea. Many sailors believed that it was lucky if a cat came up to a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it came only halfway and then turned around. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. Other sailors also believed that if a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, a terrible storm would come and sink the ship, and if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Still other sailors thought that if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed, rain was coming; and if it was frisky, wind was coming. Some of these beliefs are partly true. Cats can notice slight changes in the weather, because of their very sensitive inner ears. (Their inner ears also allow cats to land on their feet when falling.) Cats often get nervous and restless when they sense low atmospheric pressure, which often comes before stormy weather. ==Famous Ship's Cats== ===Blackie=== Blackie was HMS Prince of Wales's ship's cat. He became famous during the Second World War. Blackie's ship, Prince of Wales, carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic Ocean to Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland in August 1941. There, Churchill secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the two signed the Atlantic Charter. But as Churchill started to leave Prince of Wales, Blackie came up to him. Churchill bent down to say goodbye to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill.. Blackie survived the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales later that year and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and nobody knows what happened to him (though there is a chance he may have died by then). ===Chibbley=== Chibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship Picton Castle. She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because Picton Castle' was a training ship, Chibbley had many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea. ===Convoy=== thumb|right|Convoy sleeps in a hammock aboard HMS Hermione, while members of the crew watch Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS Hermione. He was named "Convoy" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when Hermione was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205. ===Emmy=== Emmy was the ship's cat on RMS Empress of Ireland. She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and Empress of Ireland left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, Empress of Ireland ran into SS Storstad while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. Empress of Ireland sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people. ===Felix=== Felix was the ship's cat aboard Mayflower II when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in National Geographic magazine, Life magazine, and Yankee magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures. The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation.. ===Mrs. Chippy=== Mrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard Endurance, the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that "Mrs. Chippy" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name "Mrs. Chippy," and kept using it. The ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive. ===Simon=== Simon was the ship's cat of HMS Amethyst during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS Amethyst was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of Amethyst's crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits. After the Amethyst finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in The Times (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors. ===Trim=== Trim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim. ===U-boat=== U-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck. ===Unsinkable Sam (Oscar)=== Oscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship Bismarck. When Bismarck was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS Cossack. Cossack herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS Ark Royal. Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed "Unsinkable Sam." He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. ==Ship's cats today== Starting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness).. Cats still ride on many private ships today.Chibbley's travels aboard Barque Picton Castle For example, Toolbox is a ship's cat who rides on the second Kalmar Nyckel. American sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships Dove and Return of Dove, while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965). ==References== == Other websites == * Cats in the sea services * Famous Naval Cats Category:Cats Category:Ships

Nymphaea nouchali
thumb|right|250px|The blue-flowered Nymphaea nouchali thumb|right|250px|purple version thumb|250px|right|white version Nymphaea nouchali, (or red and blue water-lily, blue star water-lily, or star lotus) is an aquatic flowering plant in the Nymphaeaceae (water-lily family). It is native to southern and eastern Asia.It is often called the "Blue lotus of India", but it is not a true lotus (of the lotus family, Nelumbaceae; the genus Lotus is in the legume family, Fabaceae). Water-lilies are also not true lilies (of the family Liliaceae). N. nouchali grows from rhizomes or tubers rooted under the water. Leaves are oval to round, 13-15 cm (5-6 in), with an open sinus at the leaf base where it attaches to the petiole (leaf stem). Leaves may spread 1.4-1.5 m (4-5 feet) from where the rhizome is rooted. Flowers, which have little fragrance, are star-shaped with 4 sepals and 10-16 petals, and are 5-13 cm (2-5 in) in diameter. Although leaves float on the water surface, flowers are generally held 30 cm (12 in) above water. They are usually pale blue (but can be pink or white) with pale yellow stamens and anthers. N. nouchali has been cultivated in southeast Asia for centuries, especially around temples. It is also cultivated in Sri Lanka and gathered from dried ponds in the Republic of India for the rhizomes, which are used as food and animal fodder as a source of starch. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is used to treat indigestion. Cultivars include N. stellata var. cyanea, which has medium-sized pale to deep blue flowers, and N. stellata var. versicolor, which is commonly exported in the form of tubers from Sri Lanka to Europe and the U.S. for use in the aquariums; the tubers grow quickly after exposure to warm water, making an "instant" aquarium plant. ==Symbolism== N. stellata was the state flower of Hyderabad Deccan. A pale blue-flowered N. stellatai is the National flower of Sri Lanka, where it is known as nil manel or nil mahanel (Singhalese:???? ??????). ==References== Category:Nymphaeales Category:Plants of Asia Category:National symbols of Sri Lanka
