Codification (law)
In law, codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction. They are listed, usually by subject, forming a legal code (a codex or book of law). Codification is the defining feature of civil law jurisdictions. ==History== Ancient Sumer's Code of Ur-Nammu was compiled 2100-2050 BC. It is the earliest known surviving civil code. Three centuries later, the Babylonian king Hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him. Religious laws such as the Torah were codified. Important codifications were developed in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the Lex Duodecim Tabularum. Much later the Corpus Iuris Civilis was assembled. These codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule. During much of ancient history the Roman laws were left mostly uncodified. The first permanent system of codified laws could be found in China. This was with the compilation of the Tang Code in AD 624. This formed the basis of the Chinese criminal code. This was then replaced by the Great Qing Legal Code. This code was in turn abolished in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China. The new laws of the Republic of China were inspired by the German codified work, the Burgerliches Gesetzbuch.Chinese law A very influential example in Europe was the French Napoleonic code of 1804. Another early system of laws is Hindu law framed by Manu and called as Manu Smriti. They date back to the 2nd century BC. The use of civil codes in Islamic Sharia law began with the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century AD. ==References== Category:Legal terms Category:International law

Cosmological principle
In modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is a prediction based on the idea that the universe is about the same in all places when viewed on a large scale. Forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe. There should, therefore, be no observable irregularities in the large scale structure. The structure is the result of the evolution of the matter field after the Big Bang. Astronomer William Keel explains: > The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a > sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for > all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that > the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the > same physical laws apply throughout.. p. 2. The two testable consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout"). The principles are closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous. == References == Category:Cosmology

Elastin
thumb|Elastin derived from cow aorta Elastin is part of connective tissue. It is an elastic protein which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored. Elastin is important in blood vessels because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, ligaments, the skin, the bladder, and elastic cartilage. It is present in all vertebrates above the jawless fish. In humans, elastin is encoded by the ELN gene. == References == Category:Animal tissues

Afar Triangle
thumb|330px|right|Topographic map showing the Afar Triangle, which correlates to the shaded area in the location map shown above The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia. == Human fossils == Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans. Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna. == Geography == The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level. The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth. The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map. === Plate tectonics === The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt. The continuous process of volcanism makes mineral deposits, like sulfur, salt, bentonite, and gypsum. There are also geothermal energy sources and hot springs in different areas of the region. In 2005, a giant rift was formed in just a few days.Giant Crack In Africa, New Scientist, November 4, 2009 The rift opened when the Dabbahu Volcano erupted. The rift is part of the process of the Arabian and African plates moving apart. This new crack, long, and deep, opened when the lava from the erupting volcano flowed underground and cooled. It left a long, wide dike within days. == References == Category:East Africa Category:Archaeological sites in Africa
Chain mail
thumb|right|228px| Mail, or chain mail,"chain mail" Cambridge dictionaries online is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour.Hazel Richardson, Life of the Ancient Celts (New York: Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), p. 28 Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest. ==Etymology== The origins* of the word "mail" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word macula, meaning "spot" or "opacity"."mail, n.3". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. Another theory relates the word to the Old French "maillier", meaning "to hammer" (related to the modern English word "malleable"). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders. *Another possible source is Italian. The word for jersey or sweater, and sometimes shirt, in modern Italian is maglia or, in French, maillot. == History == Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC.Richard A. Gabriel, The Great Armies of Antiquity (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002), p. 21 At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe.Richard A. Gabriel, The Ancient World (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006), p. 79 The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead.Encyclopedia of Military Science, ed. G. Kurt Piehler (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2013). p. 270 Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship.Ballistic Materials and Penetration Mechanics, ed. Roy Laible (Amsterdam; New York: Elsevier Scientific Pub. Co., 1980), p. 16 Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century.Michele Byam, Arms and Armor (New York, NY: DK Publishers, 2011), p. 24 == Modern uses == Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters.Gavriel Salvendy, Handbook of Human Factors and Ergonomics (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2012), p. 904 Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks.Catherine Veitch, A Daredevil's Guide to Swimming with Sharks (North Mankato, MN: Capstone Press, 2013), p. 25 But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors.Michael A. Cramer, Medieval Fantasy as Performance: The Society for Creative Anachronism and the Current Middle Ages (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2010). p. 123 It is also popular in live action role playing.Lizzie Stark, Leaving Mundania: Inside the Transformative World of Live Action Role-Playing Games (Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2012), p. 113 == Gallery == File:Verschiedene Kettenhemden.jpg|.

Triatominae
The members of Triatominae are a subfamily of Reduviidae. They are also called kissing bugs, conenose bugs, assassin bugs or triatomines. There are more than 130 species in this subfamily. Most of them feed on vertebrate blood. A few species feed on other invertebrates. They are mainly found in the Americas. There are a few species in Asia, Australia and Africa.

Junagadh State
Junagadh was a princely state in Gujarat ruled by Muslim rulers in British India until it became part of India in 1948.Richard N. Rosecrance; Arthur A. Stein, No More States?: Globalization, National Self-determination, and Terrorism (Lanham, Md: Rowman & Littlefield, 2006), p. 147 ==History== Mohammad Sher Khan Babi, a Babi Khel Pathan who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh. It declared independence in 1730 after the Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher Khan Babi, was the founder of the Babi Dynasty of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, took large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries. First they were a tributary state of Marathas. Later they were under the rule of the British Raj. In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate. The East India Company took control of the state by 1818. The Saurashtra area, with other princely states of Kathiawar, were separately administered under Kathiawar Agency by British India. On 15 August 1947 upon the independence of India, the Nawab of Junagarh decided to merge it into newly formed Pakistan. The Indian government maintained the people of Junagadh should decide. Pakistan waited until 13 September to respond saying they accepted Junagarh's acceptance of Pakistani rule. This caused a general revolt among the Hindu majority of Junagadh as well as protest movements in the surrounding states that had acceded to join India. The Nawab then occupied territory in several of those states claiming he had rule over them. When the Indian government sent a small force to restore order, the Nawab fled to Pakistan. His Dewan (Prime minister) agreed to rule by India. This resulted in the integration of Junagadh into India.Gandhi, Rajmohan (1991). Patel: A Life. India: Navajivan. p. 292. ===Rulers=== The Nawabs of Junagadh belonged to Pathan Babi khel tribe. They were granted a 13 gun salute by the British authorities: * 1730 - 1758 : Mohammad Bahadur Khanji or Mohammad Sher Khan BabiNawabs of Junagadh British Library. * 1758 - 1774 : Mohammad Mahabat Khanji I * 1774 - 1811 : Mohammad Hamid Khanji I * 1811 - 1840 : Mohammad Bahadur Khanji I * 1840 - 1851 : Mohammad Hamid Khanji II * 1851 - 1882 : Mohammad Mahabat Khanji II * 1882 - 1892 : Mohammad Bahadur Khanji II * 1892 - 1911 : Mohammad Rasul Khanji * 1911 - 1948 : Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III (last de facto ruler) {| |- valign="top" |200px|thumb| Junagadh Nawabs and state officials, 19th century. |thumb|200px|Mohammad Mahabat Khanji II, the Nawab of Junagarh, with young, Mohammad Bahadur Khanji III. 1870s. |200px|thumb|Bahadur Khanji III (r. 1882-1892), Nawab of Junagadh, and state officials, 1880s. |200px|thumb|Mohammad Rasul Khanji, Nawab of Junagadh, Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai, Wazier, Junagadh, 1890s. |} == Dispute == Many in Pakistan still maintains the 1948 plebiscite and rule by India was an illegitimate action. One of the reasons is because Kashmir at the time was ruled by a Hindu but had a clear Muslim majority. By acceding to India it was the opposite of the situation in Junagadh. For its part India knew Junagadh was the premier state in the western Kathiawar region. It was bound on three sides by states that acceded to India. On the fourth side was bounded by the Arabian Sea. This gave it great strategic importance to both countries. India was not prepared to accept Junagadh's acceding to Pakistan. This would create a Pakistan state in the middle of Indian states. India's taking administrative control of Junagadh to restore order is seen as a pretext by Pakistan. The referendum taken by the people of Junagadh, under the control of the Indian army, was overwhelmingly in favor of Indian rule. Pakistan has never accepted this vote by the people there and believes Junagadh rightly belongs to them. === Pakistan's legitimacy claim === Pakistan's government has maintained its territorial claim on Junagadh, along with Manavadar and Sir Creek in Gujarat, on its official political map issued on 4th August 2020. ==References== == Other websites == *Official Website of State of Junagadh *Classic Gallery of Indian Numismatics *Heraldry of the princely states of Gujarat Category:Territorial disputes Category:Gujarat Category:History of India Category:History of Pakistan Category:Indian princely states Category:Territorial disputes of Pakistan Category:1730 establishments Category:1948 disestablishments in India Category:1730s establishments in Asia Category:18th-century establishments in India
Nordertor
The Nordertor (Danish: Norreport) is an old town gate of the city of Flensburg. The gate was built around 1595. Today, the little landmark is in use as a symbol for the German town Flensburg.Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: Flensburg, 29 == History == In 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its town wall. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called Norder Porte. It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor.Werner Scharnweber: Flensburg, 29 This marked the northern boundary of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night.Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: Flensburg, Glossary: Nordertor On the north side of the gate are two plaques. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King Christian IV, 1577-1648 and the Latin words: ,,Regna Firmat Pietas" -- Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the German words: ,,Friede ernahrt, Unfrieden verzehrt" -- Peace nurtures, strife devours. There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was restored in the time of Christian VII, 1749-1808.Compare Flensburger Strassennamen. Gesellschaft fur Flensburger Stadtgeschichte, Flensburg 2005 , , article: Am Nordertor After 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall. There had been a ban on building outside the wall before then.Flensburger Tageblatt: Engelsby, Murwik, Jurgensby - Stadtgeschichte vor der Haustur, Februar 5. 2009. Retrieved November 28, 2015. The Neustadt (Newtown), in the neighborhood of the Nordertor was built. In 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect Paul Ziegler. The Nordertor got a clock.Lutz Wilde: Denkmaltopographie Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Kulturdenkmale in Schleswig-Holstein. Band 2, Flensburg, page 140 In 1966 the Deutsche Bundespost made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it. It was a 30 Pfennig stamp, used to send letters within Germany. The Nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times.Flensburg- Online, Nordertor, Retrieved November 28, 2015 In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings, so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate.

Ship's cat
A ship's cat is a cat that rides along on a ship. Ship's cats have been very popular in history, and date back to ancient times. Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons - most importantly, to catch mice and rats. On a ship, these rodents can damage ropes and wooden parts of the ship. Once electricity was discovered, rodents would also damage ships' electrical wiring. Also, rodents threatened the ship's cargo - the things it carried. Rodents would eat the food carried to feed the crew. If the ship was carrying things like grain as part of its cargo, rodents could also cause the ship to lose money by eating the cargo. Also, rats and mice spread disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. For example, rat fleas can carry plague, and rats on ships may have been one of the main reasons why the Black Death spread. Cats naturally attack and kill these rodents. Cats also have a natural ability to get used to new surroundings, so they could get used to serving on ships. They also offered companionship (friendship), a sense of home and security, and lifted sailors' spirits. This was helpful to sailors who could be away from home for long periods, especially in times of war. ==Early history== Cats were probably domesticated about 9,500 years ago. Not long after that, people began taking cats aboard boats and ships. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board Nile boats to catch birds in the thickets along the riverbanks.. The ancient Egyptians also carried cats on trading ships to control rodents. Traders from other areas soon started doing the same thing. This led to the spread of cats throughout the world. Cats eventually reached nearly all parts of the world that could be reached by ship. Phoenician cargo ships are thought to have brought the first domesticated cats to Europe in about 900 BC. ==Cats and superstition== Cats in Ancient Egypt were worshipped as deities (powerful spirits). For many centuries, cats have had a reputation as magical animals. Many sailors believed myths and superstitions about cats.Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions. A&C; Black, London, UK. . Cats were thought of as smart, lucky animals. Sailors usually took very good care of their ship's cats to keep them happy. Some sailors believed that six-toed cats were better at catching pests. They may have thought that extra toes give a cat better balance, which would be important when at sea. In some places, all six-toed cats became known as "ship's cats". Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too. They believed that these cats would use their special powers to protect their husbands at sea. Many sailors believed that it was lucky if a cat came up to a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it came only halfway and then turned around. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. Other sailors also believed that if a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, a terrible storm would come and sink the ship, and if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Still other sailors thought that if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed, rain was coming; and if it was frisky, wind was coming. Some of these beliefs are partly true. Cats can notice slight changes in the weather, because of their very sensitive inner ears. (Their inner ears also allow cats to land on their feet when falling.) Cats often get nervous and restless when they sense low atmospheric pressure, which often comes before stormy weather. ==Famous Ship's Cats== ===Blackie=== Blackie was HMS Prince of Wales's ship's cat. He became famous during the Second World War. Blackie's ship, Prince of Wales, carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic Ocean to Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland in August 1941. There, Churchill secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the two signed the Atlantic Charter. But as Churchill started to leave Prince of Wales, Blackie came up to him. Churchill bent down to say goodbye to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill.. Blackie survived the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales later that year and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and nobody knows what happened to him (though there is a chance he may have died by then). ===Chibbley=== Chibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship Picton Castle. She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because Picton Castle' was a training ship, Chibbley had many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea. ===Convoy=== thumb|right|Convoy sleeps in a hammock aboard HMS Hermione, while members of the crew watch Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS Hermione. He was named "Convoy" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when Hermione was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205. ===Emmy=== Emmy was the ship's cat on RMS Empress of Ireland. She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and Empress of Ireland left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, Empress of Ireland ran into SS Storstad while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. Empress of Ireland sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people. ===Felix=== Felix was the ship's cat aboard Mayflower II when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in National Geographic magazine, Life magazine, and Yankee magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures. The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation.. ===Mrs. Chippy=== Mrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard Endurance, the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that "Mrs. Chippy" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name "Mrs. Chippy," and kept using it. The ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive. ===Simon=== Simon was the ship's cat of HMS Amethyst during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS Amethyst was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of Amethyst's crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits. After the Amethyst finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in The Times (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors. ===Trim=== Trim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim. ===U-boat=== U-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck. ===Unsinkable Sam (Oscar)=== Oscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship Bismarck. When Bismarck was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS Cossack. Cossack herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS Ark Royal. Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed "Unsinkable Sam." He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. ==Ship's cats today== Starting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness).. Cats still ride on many private ships today.Chibbley's travels aboard Barque Picton Castle For example, Toolbox is a ship's cat who rides on the second Kalmar Nyckel. American sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships Dove and Return of Dove, while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965). ==References== == Other websites == * Cats in the sea services * Famous Naval Cats Category:Cats Category:Ships

Nymphaea nouchali
thumb|right|250px|The blue-flowered Nymphaea nouchali thumb|right|250px|purple version thumb|250px|right|white version Nymphaea nouchali, (or red and blue water-lily, blue star water-lily, or star lotus) is an aquatic flowering plant in the Nymphaeaceae (water-lily family). It is native to southern and eastern Asia.It is often called the "Blue lotus of India", but it is not a true lotus (of the lotus family, Nelumbaceae; the genus Lotus is in the legume family, Fabaceae). Water-lilies are also not true lilies (of the family Liliaceae). N. nouchali grows from rhizomes or tubers rooted under the water. Leaves are oval to round, 13-15 cm (5-6 in), with an open sinus at the leaf base where it attaches to the petiole (leaf stem). Leaves may spread 1.4-1.5 m (4-5 feet) from where the rhizome is rooted. Flowers, which have little fragrance, are star-shaped with 4 sepals and 10-16 petals, and are 5-13 cm (2-5 in) in diameter. Although leaves float on the water surface, flowers are generally held 30 cm (12 in) above water. They are usually pale blue (but can be pink or white) with pale yellow stamens and anthers. N. nouchali has been cultivated in southeast Asia for centuries, especially around temples. It is also cultivated in Sri Lanka and gathered from dried ponds in the Republic of India for the rhizomes, which are used as food and animal fodder as a source of starch. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is used to treat indigestion. Cultivars include N. stellata var. cyanea, which has medium-sized pale to deep blue flowers, and N. stellata var. versicolor, which is commonly exported in the form of tubers from Sri Lanka to Europe and the U.S. for use in the aquariums; the tubers grow quickly after exposure to warm water, making an "instant" aquarium plant. ==Symbolism== N. stellata was the state flower of Hyderabad Deccan. A pale blue-flowered N. stellatai is the National flower of Sri Lanka, where it is known as nil manel or nil mahanel (Singhalese:???? ??????). ==References== Category:Nymphaeales Category:Plants of Asia Category:National symbols of Sri Lanka

Frequency probability
Frequency probability or Frequentism is one of the interpretations of probability theory. Repeating a scientific experiment very often gives a number of results. It is then possible, to count the number of times that a given event happened and compare it to the total number of experiments. This interpretation of probabiilty was very important for statistics. People who use this interpretation are often called Frequentists. Well-known frequentists include Richard von Mises, Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, R. A. Fisher and John Venn. Other interpretations of probability are Bayesian probability and Axiomatic probability theory Category:Probability theory Category:Statistics

Autonomic dysreflexia
Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), also called autonomic hyperreflexia, is a medical emergency. == Who Gets Autonomic Dysreflexia? == AD usually happens in people with spinal cord injuries that have caused damage above the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6, which is about at the same level of the armpits). However, AD sometimes happens in people with spinal damage as low as their tenth thoracic vertebra (T10, which is about a few inches above the level of the belly button). AD can also happen in people with diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). == Symptoms == Acute AD causes many symptoms. Some are very dangerous. These symptoms include: * Hypertensive emergency: the person's blood pressure gets very high all of a sudden. The blood pressure can get so high that it can cause a stroke. * bradycardia, a slow heart rate. If the heart beats too slowly, the rest of the body cannot get enough blood or oxygen. This is dangerous, because every part of the body needs blood (which carries oxygen) to survive. For example: ** If the brain does not get enough oxygen, a person can get brain damage or die. ** If the heart does not get enough oxygen, it can stop beating normally or even stop beating completely. * Bad headaches * Very bad sweating * Stuffy nose * Skin flushing (redness) above the level of the spinal injury * anxiety * Thinking problems == What Causes Autonomic Dysreflexia? == Acute AD happens when the involuntary nervous system gets overexcited. The body's fight or flight response kicks in very strongly. Scientists think this happens because of afferent nerves. Afferent nerves are supposed to sense things (like touch) and send messages back to the brain and spinal cord so the brain can decide how to react. Scientists think that afferent nerves below the spinal cord injury cause blood pressure to get and stay high, by causing the blood vessels to get smaller. This is part of the fight or flight response. ==References== Category:Medical emergencies Category:Nervous system

Breath sounds
Breath sounds are the sounds made by air as it moves through the respiratory system. Breath sounds are also called lung sounds or respiratory sounds. Sometimes they can be heard by anyone; other times they can be heard only by listening to the lungs and airways with a stethoscope. To describe and identify breath sounds, medical professionals usually use auscultation (they listen with a stethoscope). They listen while the patient is breathing in, and while they are breathing out. They listen to both lungs, at both the chest and the back, starting at the bottom and working their way up. They listen to whether the pitch of the breath sounds is low, medium or high. They also listen to whether the sounds are soft, medium, loud, or very loud). ==Abnormal Breath Sounds== There are many kinds of breath sounds that are not normal. These are called adventitious breath sounds. Each different kind of abnormal breath sound is a sign of a different problem. Some of the most common abnormal breath sounds are: ===Wheezing=== Wheezing is usually high-pitched. It sounds musical, like whistling. Usually, wheezing is heard first when a person is breathing out. If it gets worse, wheezing starts happening when the patient breathes in and out. Wheezing is caused by the airways being too narrow. This can happen because of diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). If the airways are too narrow, the oxygen the body needs cannot get through. This can become a medical emergency. There are a few different treatments that can be used for wheezing: * The patient can be given supplemental (extra) oxygen through a mask. * Sometimes, moist, hot air can help wheezing. Sitting in an area like a shower, or using a vaporizer (which creates moist, warm air) may be helpful for mild wheezing. Emergency medical technicians or hospitals can also give humidified oxygen, which is mixed with warm water to make the oxygen into a warm steam. * There are medicines called bronchodilators that relax and open up the airways. This reverses the cause of wheezing and makes it easier to breathe. Albuterol is a very common bronchodilator and is carried on many ambulances. Bronchodilators can be given in inhalers or in a nebulizer (which mixes the medicine with warm water to make the medicine into steam). ===Stridor=== Stridor is a high-pitched sound that usually happens when a person breathes in. It may sound a lot like wheezing. Medical professionals can tell the difference by listening to the throat with a stethoscope. If the sound they hear is louder in the throat, it is stridor, not wheezing. Stridor is usually caused by something blocking the larynx (voice box). This can happen because: * A person is choking and an object is blocking the larynx * A person has an infection, and swelling in the throat or airways blocks the larynx * The muscles in the airway or vocal cords spasm (suddenly get tighter); this is called laryngospasm Like wheezing, stridor can signal a medical emergency if not enough oxygen is able to get through the airways. Treatment for stridor depends on the cause: * Helping a person stop choking by using choke saving (like the Heimlich maneuver) * Treating the infection that is causing swelling in the larynx * Giving medicines to help the muscles in the airway or vocal cords relax * No matter what the cause is, giving extra oxygen may also help Children are more likely to have stridor because of choking. They are more likely to choke because their airways are smaller. They are also more likely to get childhood infections like croup or epiglottitis that can cause stridor. ===Rales (fine crackles)=== Rales are also called fine crackles, because they often sound like a fine crackling noise. They are heard when a person breathes in, on both sides (in both lungs). Rales may also sound like bubbling, rattling, or small clicking sounds. Rales are heard when a person has fluid in their lungs. This is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema may happen for many reasons, like: * Congestive heart failure (CHF) * Pneumonia or other infections in the lungs * Injury to the lung * Blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) * Breathing in smoke * Drowning Rales signals pulmonary edema, no matter what is causing that pulmonary edema. When a medical professional listens to the lungs, rales usually start at the bottom of the lungs. As the pulmonary edema gets worse and fluid fills the lungs more, rales can be heard closer and closer to the top of the lungs. ===Rhonchi (coarse crackles)=== Rhonchi are also called coarse crackles, because they sound like coarse, rattling, crackling sounds. Rhonchi and rales can sound a lot alike. The main differences are: * Rales start at the bottom of the lungs and can be heard farther up as the patient gets sicker. They are heard on both sides (in both lungs) together. * Rhonchi are often heard just in certain spots in the lungs. They do not always start at the bottom of the lungs. They may be heard only on one side, or in different spots on both sides. Rhonchi are usually caused by mucus in the bronchi, the tubes that lead to the lungs. For example, if a person has pneumonia, mucus can build up in their bronchi and the bronchi's airways, and cause rhonchi. ===Unequal breath sounds=== In a healthy person, breath sounds should always sound the same on both sides. This signals that both lungs are working well. If breath sounds cannot be heard in one lung, this can signal a serious problem. It means that air is not getting in and out of that lung. One of the most common causes of unequal breath sounds is a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). A lung can collapse for many different reasons: * A very bad injury to the lung * Lung diseases like asthma, COPD, tuberculosis (TB), whooping cough, pneumonia, or cystic fibrosis * Sometimes air blisters called blebs form on the top of the lungs. If these air blisters break, air can leak out of the lungs and cause the lung to collapse. * Sometimes, a lung can collapse on its own. This is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. A pneumothorax is often a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital. ==References== Category:Respiratory system

He can help the player who damages him enough on the Pyrosphere stage. ==References== Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1986 Category:Metroid Category:Nintendo video game characters Category:Video game characters
Sulfur cycle
The sulfur cycle is the way sulfur moves between rocks, waterways and living systems. Sulfur (S) is an element important to ecosystems and the climate. The majority of sulfur is stored underground, for example under the ocean or in rocks. It also occurs naturally in places like swamps (where organisms have decomposed) and volcanoes. Humans add excess sulfur into this cycle, usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion. == Steps of the sulfur cycle == *As rocks are worn down by erosion they release sulfur that was once stored, becoming SO4 once it touches the air *Plants absorb this sulfur through photosynthesis and make this sulfur organic *Animals, specifically herbivores and omnivores consume the sulfur when they eat the plants *Sulfur moves through the food chain as secondary consumers and tertiary consumers eat the primary consumers *When animals and plants die, the sulfur dissipates into the atmosphere as sulfate and also through the body of the decomposers *The sulfur in the atmosphere is returned to the soil and water cycle when it rains Sulfur can also be naturally released when volcanoes explode. The hydrological cycle plays a critical role in moving sulfur around. == Human Impact on the sulfur cycle == Humans are responsible for 1/3 of the sulfur in the atmosphere. Sulfur is released by the combustion of fossil fuels, as mentioned above, and is most prevalent as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is one of the root causes of acid rain along with nitrogen and carbon which negatively affects the environment. Acid rain is created when the H2O falls and combines with the Sulfur trioxide to create Sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is also used in most fertilizers and so can be introduced into the water cycle from runoff off of nearby farms into rivers and lakes. This causes eutrophication and algal blooms, and so reduced the Dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in that water system. Sulfur in the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide also absorbs radiation, however which keeps the earth's surface cooler and combats some of the effects of global warming. Category:Biochemistry

Carbon sequestration
Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the atmosphere. One method of sequestration is by capturing CO2 produced by power plants and factories before they release it into the atmosphere. When the CO2 gas is in long-term storage, that means it has been sequestered. Carbon sequestration aims to assist in elimination of human introduced carbon from Earth's atmosphere by disrupting the carbon cycle. It is also used to prevent future human caused climate change. == Methods == There are two long- term ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere: # Terrestrial Sequestration- plants and trees store CO2 in their bodies and in their roots. # geologic sequestration- bury the CO2 thousands of feet underground. == References == Category:Environmental issues Category:Atmosphere

African plate
thumb|right|280px|The African Plate The African Plate is a major tectonic plate. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as the oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Since the continent of Africa includes the African Plate and the smaller plates to its right, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole. Between 60 million years ago (mya) and 10 mya, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift. One hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the Afar region. Another hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards. The African Plate's speed is about per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate. There is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust (in parts of the central and eastern Mediterranean). Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate. The African, Somali and Arabian Plates were once all part of the great southern supercontinent Gondwana, as was the Indian subcontinent. == References == Category:Tectonic plates Category:Africa

Service animals may also be called assistance animals, assist animals, support animals, or helper animals, depending on the country and what the animal does. == Types == There are three basic types of assistance animals:International Association of Assistance Dog Partners Retrieved on October 17, 2007. # Guide animals, like guide dogs, who guide (lead) people who are blind # Hearing animals, like hearing dogs, who help the deaf by signaling when they hear important sounds # Service animals, who do work for people with disabilities who are not blind or deaf In the United States, as of the 2011 changes to Americans with Disabilities Act regulation only dogs may be used as service animals for the purposes of going to public places. However, in certain situations miniature horses are supposed to be accommodated the same as service animals that are dogs. The U.S. government does not recognize a right to use any other species as an assistance animal in public places where pets would not be permitted except on commercial aircraft.

For example, some dogs can be trained to: * Sense that their owner is going to have a seizure, and help them in different ways (see seizure response dog) * Sense that their owner's blood sugar is getting low, and alert them to check their blood sugar * Go get help from a certain person, set off an alarm, or call 911 with a special phone if their owner has an emergency * Do things for owners in wheelchairs, like press buttons (see the picture at the top of the page), open a refrigerator, carry bags, open the door, and many other tasks * Help people who have trouble walking keep steady and walk safely Dogs can also be trained to help owners with psychiatric (mental health) disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to: * Bring medicine to a person who is having a panic attack * Bring a portable phone, or call 911 or a suicide hotline on a special phone if their owner is feeling suicidal (wants to kill himself or herself) * Wake up a person with PTSD who is having a night terror * Realize when their owner is getting angry or anxious, signaling them and trying to distract them (for example, by nudging them or licking their face) These are just examples of some of the things service dogs can do. Service dogs can also be trained to do many, many more things for people with all kinds of disabilities. ===Miniature horses=== Miniature horses are horses that are usually less than three feet tall. They can be trained to: * Guide a blind owner, just like a guide dog wouldGuide Horse Retrieved on October 17, 2007. * Pull a wheelchair * Help support an owner with Parkinson's disease, which can make it hard to walk and easy to fall. By bracing against the horse, the owner can walk more easily and safely. An owner might choose a miniature horse as a service animal because they are allergic to dogs, or because their religion says that dogs are unclean. Miniature horses can also live and work for about 30 years, much longer than a service dog. ===Capuchin monkeys=== Are not allowed in buildings with a "no animal" policy. They may be used at home or outside where any animal is allowed, but under the 2011 ADA revision, only canines and in some cases miniature horses, are legally recognized as public access service animals. Capuchin monkeys can be trained to do things with their hands, like:Helping Hands Retrieved on October 17, 2007. * Picking things up * Opening doorknobs * Turning on light switches * Turning the pages of a book * Microwaving food and opening drink bottles * Washing their owner's face Helper monkeys can be helpful to people who have trouble with using their hands and arms, like people with quadriplegia, very bad spinal cord injuries, very bad injuries to their hands and arms, and multiple sclerosis. thumb|Helping Hands - Monkey Helpers Service monkey washing itself Helper monkeys are usually raised in a human home as infants. Then they get years of training, usually in schools by private organizations. On average, they take 7 years to train. They are usually able to serve as helper monkeys for 25-30 years (two to three times longer than a service dog). Not everyone agrees that monkeys should be service animals. Debbie Leahy, manager of captive wildlife protection for the Humane Society of the United States, says that monkeys are not real service animals and that sometimes they are abused during their training. In the United States, helper monkeys are also not counted as service animals under most laws. == Animals which cannot be service animals == If an animal has not been trained to do a job or task that will help a person with a disability, it cannot be a service animal. Some people with mental health problems, like anxiety or PTSD, use different kinds of animals to give them comfort (make them feel better) when they are upset. These animals are called "comfort animals" (or "Emotional Support Animals"). Some people use unusual comfort animals, like snakes, tarantulas, guinea pigs, turtles, and rats. Even if having the animal makes the owner feel better, these animals cannot be service animals because it is impossible to train them to do something to help a person with a disability. Even if a comfort animal is a dog or a miniature horse, being a comfort animal is not the same as being a service animal. Comfort animals make their owners feel better just by being there. A service animal is trained to recognize that there is a problem and do the job they were trained to do to help their owner. For example, a psychiatric service dog would recognize that its owner is feeling upset and do a specific job, like get medicine, get help, or distract the person, to help them. ==Laws in the United States== In the United States, service animals have some protection under the law. Different laws set rules about service animals in different situations. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service animals in public places. Other laws, for example, control which service animals are allowed in housing. But these different laws do not agree on what counts as a service animal. ===The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)=== In 1990, the United States passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Its goal was to protect the rights of people with disabilities. At first, it mentioned only guide dogs as service animals. Since then, it has been changed to include more protections. It now defines a service animal as any "dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities." This means that only dogs count as service animals under the ADA. However, there is a special section in the new ADA about miniature horses. This section says that places covered by the ADA (like businesses) should allow miniature horses "where reasonable." To decide whether allowing a miniature horse into a place is "reasonable," those places are allowed to use four questions: # Is the miniature horse housebroken? # Is the miniature horse under its owner's control? # Does the place have room for the miniature horse? # If the miniature horse is allowed in, will the place still be able to meet all of its safety rules and requirements? If the answer to all four questions is "yes," the place needs to let the miniature horse in, and treat it like a service animal. Other than service dogs and service miniature horses, no other type of assistance animal is protected under the ADA. ==== Protections for service animals ==== Under the ADA, it is illegal to refuse to let a service animal or its owner into: * Any business * Any government agency * Any "public accommodation" (any place where members of the public are allowed to go) - like movie theaters, museums, malls, schools, parks, and ambulances In these places, it is also illegal to treat a person with a service animal differently than any other person. The person with a service animal cannot be charged extra money, refused service, or kept apart from other people. A service animal can be asked to leave one of these places only if it is out of control (for example, if it is aggressive or urinates inside). The animal has to be on a leash, or controlled by its owner's voice or signals, all the time. No one can ask for proof that the animal is a service animal. Owners do not have to carry any special papers or prove that their service animal can do a special task. If an owner and a service animal enter one of these places, workers are only allowed to ask two questions to make sure the animal is a service animal and not a pet: # Is this a service animal that you need because of a disability? (Nobody is allowed to ask the owner to explain what their disability is.) # What work or task is the dog trained to do? It is legal to train your own service animal in the United States. Service animals do not get these same protections in most religious organizations. Most religious organizations are exempt from the ADA's requirements, which means they do not have to obey the ADA. ===Other laws=== Other laws have less strict definitions of which animals count as service animals. For example, the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act allows "dogs and other service animals" to ride with passengers on commercial airlines. The Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals). This law does not say that only certain animals are allowed. ==Laws in other countries== ===Mexico & South America=== In most places in South America and Mexico, the place's owner or manager gets to decide whether to let a service animal in. There are no laws that protect service animals or their owners. In areas with many tourists, service dogs are generally welcomed without problems. In Brazil, however, the President created a new law about service dogs in 2006. The law says that all service dogs in Brazil must be allowed to go anywhere that the public could go. The Brasilia Metro (the Brazilian public transportation system) has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it. ===Europe=== Different European countries have different laws about service animals. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country, and sometimes different parts of the country govern themselves. ===Australia=== In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 legally protects all assistance dog handlers. However, with current laws, owners may not always be allowed to have their service animals with them in all situations.Paul Harpur, 'The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Australian anti-discrimination laws: What Happened to the Legal Protections for People Using Guide or Assistance Dogs?' (2010) 29 University of Tasmania Law Review 1, 49-77. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly have to do with guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009, which protects all certified assistance dogs. ===Canada=== In Canada, any service animal is allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of the animal. In Alberta, there is a fine of up to $3000 for someone who refuses to let a service dog into a place where everyone else could go. ===South Korea=== In South Korea, the law says service dogs must be let into any areas that are open to the public. People who break this law can be fined for up to 2 million won (about $1691 in United States dollars). ==Related pages== * Seizure response dog * Guide dog * Hearing dog ==References==
Extortion
thumb|right|200px In law, extortion is a criminal offense. It is obtaining money, property, or service from a person or institution, through coercion. This may be by threat to a victim, to their property or family. It may also be by false claim (such as claiming to be a public official). Another form of extortion is offering a business owner "protection"; for example, to keep the business free from vandalism or burglary. In all states of the United States extortion is a felony. Extortion may be in person, by telephone, mail, e-mail, text message or any form of wireless communication. If the extortion involves any form of interstate commerce, it may be a federal crime. It may involve the threat of hacking. Extortion, like robbery and blackmail, are crimes that involve obtaining property by illegal means. The most serious of the three is robbery because it usually involves violence against the victim. Blackmail is a form of extortion. The threat is usually making damaging or embarrassing information public if demands are not met. The legal definition of extortion varies from one jurisdiction to another. In some states, extortion is only charged against public officials while the same act committed by a private individual is charged as blackmail. == References == Category:Law Category:Legal terms

Kayapo people
The Kayapo (Portuguese: Caiapo ) people are an indigenous people in Brazil. They are found along the plain islands of the Mato Grosso and Para in Brazil, south of the Amazon Basin and along Rio Xingu and its tributaries. Kayapo call themselves "Mebengokre", which means "people of the wellspring". Kayapo people also call outsiders "Poanjos". ==Location== The Kayapo tribe live alongside the Xingu River in the eastern part of the Amazon Rainforest, near the Amazon basin. They live in several scattered villages ranging in population from, one hundred to one thousand people in Brazil.Dowie, Mark. Conservation Refugees: The Hundred-Year Conflict between Global Conservation and Native Peoples. The MIT Press. 2009. Chapter 15. 978-0-262-01261-4. Their land consists of tropical rainforest savannah (grassland). It is arguably the largest tropical protected area in the world covering 11,346,326 million hectares.Posey, Darrel A., Indigenous Management of Tropical Forest Ecosystems: The Case of the Kayapo Indians of the Brazilian Amazon. Dove, Michael R., & Carpenter, C., Environmental Anthropology: A Historical Reader. Blackwell Publishing. 2008. Part 1.1. 978-1-4051-1125-6. They have small hills scattered around their land and the area is criss-crossed by river valleys. The larger rivers feed into numerous pools and creeks, most of which don't have official names. In 2010, there was an estimated 8,638 Kayapo people. which is an increase from 7,096 in 2003. Subgroups of the Kayapo include the Xikrin, Gorotire, Mekranoti and Metyktire. Their villages typically consist of a dozen huts. A centrally located hut serves as a meeting place for village men to discuss community issues. One of the Kayapo tribes, all of the women shave a distinctive V shape into their scalp. == References == Category:South American people
Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus
Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus was a 1st century king of the Regnenses in early Roman Britain. Cogidubnus ruled at Chichester.R G Collingwood; J N L Myres, Roman Britain and the English Settlements (New York, NY: Biblo and Tannen, 1998), pp. 85-87 When the Roman Emperor Claudius conquered Britain he set himself up at Colchester and received the submission of the various tribes. Cogidubnus was one of those who submitted to him. Claudius confirmed Cogidubnus' kingdom and even expanded its borders. Cogidubnus was given the unusual title rex legatus Augusti in Britannia. When Cogidubnus became a Roman citizen he took the name "Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus". He was a loyal client-king to the Romans.Graham Webster, Rome Against Caratacus: The Roman Campaigns in Britain AD 48-58 (London: Routledge, 1981), p. 130 He convinced his people to remain loyal to india . == References == Category:History of England
Religious law
Religious law comes from the sacred texts of various religions. They cover most parts of personal and contract law. Most religious law systems are either based on Islamic law (Sharia) or Judaic law (Halakha).Marci Hoffman; Mary Rumsey, International and Foreign Legal Research: A Coursebook, Second Edition (Leiden; Boston: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2012), p. 4 Religious laws generally are used in countries that also have other legal systems such as civil or common law. == Comparisons == Religious laws are seen to be eternal and do not change over time. Secular laws (non-religious) can be changed by their lawmakers. Religious laws govern people's behaviors and their beliefs. Secular laws deal with people's actions and how they affect other people. In religious law, disputes are settled by officials of that religion combining the actions of a judge and a priest. In secular systems the judiciary is independent. == Religious legal systems == === Sharia === Sharia deals with many topics, including crime, politics, marriage contracts, trade regulations, religious instructions, and economics. It also covers personal matters such as sexual intercourse, hygiene, diet, prayer, everyday etiquette and fasting. Adherence to sharia is an important part of the Muslim faith. Natana J. DeLong-Bas, Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 93 In the strictest sense, sharia is considered in Islam as the infallible law of God.Noel J Coulson, A history of Islamic law (Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2011), p. 4 There are two primary sharia: the Quran, and the Hadiths (opinions and life example of Muhammad). For issues not directly covered in these primary sources, sharia is used. The sources differ between the various sects of Islam (Sunni and Shia are the majority). They also differ by the various jurisprudence schools such as Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi'i.Global issues : selections from CQ Researcher (Washington, DC: CQ Press, 2013), p. 229 === Haleakala === Historically, in the diaspora, halakha served many Jewish communities as both civil and religious law. There was no difference in classical Judaism. Modern religious leaders have come to view the halakha as less binding in day-to-day life. This is because it relies on Rabbinic interpretation instead of the pure, written words written in the Hebrew Bible. Under contemporary Israeli law certain areas of Israeli family and personal law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts. This means they are treated according to halakha. Some differences in halakha itself are found among Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardi, Yemenite and other Jews who historically lived in isolated communities. == Reference == Category:Law Category:Legal terms
Moeraki Boulders
thumb|250px|The Moeraki Boulders at sunrise The Moeraki Boulders are a rock formation in New Zealand. They are unusually large and spherical boulders on Koekohe Beach on the Otago coast, between Moeraki and Hampden. Some of the boulders are in groups, while others stand by themselves. The area has been protected in a scientific reserve. The boulders sit in mudstone, which is eroded by the action of the waves along the beach. This leaves the boulders exposed on the sand.Boles, J.R., C.A. Landis, and P. Dale, 1985, The Moeraki Boulders; anatomy of some septarian concretions, Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, vol. 55, n. 3, p. 398-406.Fordyce, E., and P.

Local Maori legends say the boulders as the remains of eel baskets, calabashes, and kumara washed ashore from the wreck of Arai-te-uru, a large sailing canoe. The rocks that extend seaward from Shag Point are the petrified hull of this shipwreck. A nearby rocky promontory is the body of the canoe's captain. In 1848 a drawing of the beach and its boulders, shows there were more than now. This picture is now in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington.Dann, C. and N. Peat, 1989, Dunedin, North and South Otago. GP Books. Wellington, New Zealand. . The boulders were described in 1850 colonial reports and numerous popular articles since that time. In more recent times they have become a popular tourist attraction, often described and pictured in numerous web pages and tourist guides.Mutch, A. R., 1966, Moeraki Boulders in A.H.

The Rodeo had an optional V6 engine and four-wheel drive. The first series Rodeos had a number of safety issues. It had very poor crash test scores. Front airbags were installed for the first time in 1995. The second generation Rodeo came out in 1998. A new V6 engine gave it much more power. While the exterior design did not change very much, it became known as one of the best SUVs available at the time. But it could not keep up with the other SUVs in the market. Isuzu would later replace the Rodeo with the Ascender, a badge-engineered GMC Envoy in 2005 == References == Category:Automobiles Category:Sport utility vehicles

Abduction
Abduction is the criminal act of taking a person away by means of fraud, persuasion, by threat of violence or by force. Kidnapping, by comparison, is limited to a threat of violence or forcefully taking adults or the by the taking of children. It often involves some form of false imprisonment. In some states, kidnapping and abduction are treated as the same thing. But in most jurisdictions they are separate crimes. Unlawful interference with family members such as removing a child from its parents is abduction. It does not matter if the minor consents or not. Kidnapping is the unlawful taking of a person against their will. Abduction can also mean the taking of any female person for the purposes of prostitution, concubinage or (forced) marriage. == Child abduction == During wars, children are often abducted. They may be treated brutally or killed. They may be victims of sexual violence or may be used as soldiers. Children are abducted both by armed parties or governments. They may be taken as an act of retaliation against a population. == International child abduction == When a marriage breaks down, it is not uncommon for one parent to wish to return, with his or her children, to their state of origin.John Murphy, International Dimensions in Family Law (Manchester, UK: Manchester University Press, 2005), p. 208 This is usually without the permission of the other parent. This becomes an international child abduction. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child requires "State Parties shall take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad". Also that they "promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements". International child abductions are a matter treated by civil law and in some cases criminal law. == References == == Other websites == * Abduction vs Kidnapping, Kids Live Safe * Family Abduction, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children Category:Law Category:Legal terms Category:International law

Saimaa ringed seal
The Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis) is a subspecies of ringed seal (Pusa hispida). Usually seals live in the sea, but Saimaa ringed seals live in Lake Saimaa in Finland. There are only 320 Saimaa ringed seals in the world. They are among the most endangered seals in the world. After the last ice age was over, dry land was rising slowly. This isolated Lake Saimaa from the sea. Some seals were also isolated in Saimaa. Their successors become Saimaa ringed seals. ==Appearance== An adult Saimaa ringed seal is between long and weighs between . Usually male seals are larger than females. Their colour is dark gray, with circular white ring patterns. Saimaa ringed seal SLL 2015 == Reproduction == Saimaa ringed seals give birth towards the end of February. They dig a nest in snow on top of lake ice. Snow nest gives shelter for young seal pups. If there is not enough snow, young seals do not survive. In 2010s, volunteers help seals by building artificial piles of snow on lake ice. Studies by the University of Eastern Finland showed the ringed seals would nest in man-made snowdrifts the same as natural snowdrifts. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Pinnipeds
Regnenses
thumb|right|200px| The Regnenses, Regni or Regini were a British Celtic people. They were ruled by a king. Their their territory or kingdom was later a civitas of Roman Britain. Their capital was Noviomagus Reginorum, known today as Chichester in modern West Sussex. Before the Romans conquered Britain their land and capital appear to have been part of the territory of the Atrebates.Patricia Southern, The Story of Roman Bath (Stroud, UK: Amberley, 2012), pp. xiii-xxiii Possibly they were part of a confederation of tribes. The tribe made use of hill forts more than other tribes around them. Their location in southern England would have made them a more civilized people. They would have had contact with Europe through trading exposing them to new ideas. 'Regninses', means "people of the kingdom". It is not known how they came by that name. It was recorded by the Romans but it could be a translation or a name the Romans gave them. Their ruler was Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus. Tacitus said of him: The theory that Cogidubnus was created legatus, a rank only ever given to senators, is based on reconstructing the damaged Chichester inscription. It would read as Cogidubni regis legati Augusti in Britannia ("king and imperial legate in Britain").John Allen Moore, The Worship of the Roman Emperors in the Province of Britain (Chicago, 1903), p. 17 It could also be Cogidubni regis magni Britanniae ("great king of Britain").Graham Webster, Rome Against Caratacus: The Roman Campaigns in Britain AD 48-58 (London: Taylor & Francis, 2003), pp. 124-125 ==References== Category:History of England
Eye-spot (mimicry)
An eye-spot (or ocellus) is an eye-like marking on the body of an animal. They are found on butterflies, reptiles, felids, birds and fish. Eye-spots may be a form of mimicry: the spot looks like the eye of a larger animal. Its function may be to draw a predator's attention away from the most vulnerable body parts; or to look like an unpleasant or dangerous animal. Stevens, Martin & Ruxton, Graeme D. 2014. Do animal eyespots really mimic eyes? Current Zoology 60, 1, p26. Blest A.D. 1957. The function of eyespot patterns in the Lepidoptera. Behavour 11, 209255. In larger animals, eyespots may play a role in intraspecies communication or courtship - the best-known example is probably the eyespots on a peacock's display feathers. There is evidence that eyespots in butterflies are anti-predator defences. Some are deimatic displays to distract, startle or scare off predators, or at least to deflect attacks away from vital body parts. Butterfly eyespots may also play a role in mate recognition and sexual selection, like the eyespots on larger organisms. == References == Category:Ethology Category:Mimicry
Property tax
A property tax (or millage tax) is a levy on property that the owner is required to pay. The tax is imposed by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The tax may be paid to a national, state, provincial, county, regional, or municipality governmant. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. This is in contrast to a rent or mortgage tax, which is based on a percentage of the rent or mortgage value. There are four broad types of property: land, immovable property, personal property and intellectual property. Real property (also called real estate or realty) means the combination of land and improvements. Under a property tax system, the government requires and/or performs an appraisal of the monetary value of each property. A tax is assessed based on that value. Forms of property tax used vary among countries and jurisdictions. Real property is often taxed based on its classification. Classification is the grouping of properties based on similar use. Properties in different classes are taxed at different rates. Examples of different classes of property are residential, commercial, industrial and vacant real property. In Israel, for example, property tax rates are double for vacant apartments versus occupied apartments.https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Bill-to-double-property-tax-on- Jerusalems-ghost-apartments-approved-439361 In the Canadian province of British Columbia a speculation tax on residential properties has been introduced in 2019. A special assessment tax is sometimes confused with property tax. These are two distinct forms of taxation: one (Ad valorem tax) relies upon the appraised fair market value of the property being taxed. The other (special assessment) relies upon a special enhancement called a "benefit" for its justification. The property tax rate is often given as a percentage. It may also be expressed as a per mille (amount of tax per thousand currency units of property value), which is also known as a millage rate or mill (which is also one-thousandth of a currency unit). To calculate the property tax, the authority will multiply the assessed value of the property by the mill rate. Then they will divide by 1,000. For example, a property with an assessed value of $50,000 located in a municipality with a mill rate of 20 mills would have a property tax bill of $1,000 per year. == References == Category:Taxation Category:Law

Murder of Laquan McDonald
thumb|right|A memorial from protesters shortly after the video's release, November 24, 2015 The shooting of Laquan McDonald occurred on October 20, 2014, in Chicago, Illinois, when McDonald--a 17-year-old black male armed with a knife--was shot 16 times by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke. As a result, mayor Rahm Emanuel fired Chicago police superintendent Garry McCarthy on December 1, 2015. Few days later, Emanuel apologized for the shooting, but since then, Emanuel has received criticisms and negative comments towards him and his administration. Video of the shooting, captured on one police cruiser's dashboard camera, was released to the public on November 24, 2015, over 13 months after the shooting. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder within hours after the video's release. After turning himself in to authorities, he was initially ordered held without bail at Cook County Jail, but released on November 30 after posting bail. On November 25, Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders released a statement sending condolences to McDonald's family and criticizing the Emanuel administration and the Chicago's police force. There have been numerous protests denouncing Laquan McDonald's death. In November 27, a major day for shopping in the U.S., a group of protesters chanted "sixteen shots" and other slogans while marching on Michigan Avenue, the city's central shopping district. This caused some businesses to shut their doors and the police closed Michigan Avenue, a six- lane street. The FBI opened an investigation into McDonald's death, and the city of Chicago approved a five-million dollar settlement in April 2015, although no lawsuit was filed. The police had originally claimed that McDonald had lunged at an officer. However, video footage contradicts that claim; McDonald made no lunges. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, as well as 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. ==References== ==Other websites== *External video dashcam footage *Coban, manufacturer of dashboard cameras used by the Chicago Police Category:2014 in Illinois Category:2010s in Chicago Category:2010s murders in the United States Category:Murder in 2014 Category:Murders by firearm in the United States Category:October 2014 events Category:People shot and killed by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Black Lives Matter

Phillips curve
thumb|right|250px| The Phillips Curve shows the relationship between unemployment and wage inflation in an economy. It shows that as unemployment goes down, wages go up. It was discovered by British economist William Phillips. He studied wage inflation and unemployment in the United Kingdom from 1861 to 1957. The theory states that economic growth causes inflation. This causes more jobs to become available which lowers unemployment. In the 1970s high levels of inflation and unemployment were occurring at the same time. This disproved the theory, at least in the long run. Many economists feel that the Phillips curve still has value in the short run where there is still a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. == Related pages == * Microeconomics * Economy * Monetary policy == References == Category:Economics

Shipwreck
A shipwreck is the remains of a ship that has been wrecked. Shipwrecks are found either beached on land or sunken to the seabed of a body of water. They may be deliberate or accidental. UNESCO estimates that worldwide over 3 million shipwrecks. Some are thousands of years old. == Attraction == thumb|A sunken ship in Egypt Historic wrecks are attractive to marine archaeologists because they preserve historical information. For example, studying the wreck of Mary Rose revealed information about seafaring, warfare, and life in the 16th century. Military wrecks, caused by a battle at sea, are studied to find details about the historic events. They can reveal much about the battle that occurred. Once in a while there is a discovery of a treasure ship, often from the period of European colonisation. Some contemporary wrecks, such as the oil tankers Prestige or Erika, are of interest because of their potential harm to the environment. Other contemporary wrecks are scuttled (sank deliberately) in order to create reef growth. == Famous shipwrecks == Some very famous shipwrecks include the RMS Titanic, HMHS Britannic, RMS Lusitania, SS Andrea Doria, SS Edmund Fitzgerald or the Costa Concordia. There are also thousands of wrecks that were not lost at sea but have been abandoned or sunk. These abandoned, or derelict ships are typically smaller craft, such as fishing vessels. They sometimes pose a hazard to navigation. == References == == Other websites == * 10 Shipwrecks Frozen In Time * International Registry of Sunken Ships Category:Ships

Juan Ponce de Leon
Juan Ponce de Leon (1460-1521) was a Spanish nobleman, explorer and colonial governor. Looking for gold and a rumored "Fountain of Youth, he landed on the southeast coast of North America near present-day St. Augustine, Florida. He claimed the lands for Spain and named it La Florida (place of flowers). In 1521, on his second trip to Florida, he was wounded in an attack. The expedition returned to Cuba where he died in July 1521 from his wound. == Early life == Ponce de Leon was born in 1460 in Santervas de Campos, Spain. He was born into a poor but noble family. His parents may have died while he was still young. He was sent to the estate of Pedro Nunez de Guzman, Lord of Toral, to serve as a page.Steven Otfinoski, Juan Ponce de Leon: Discoverer of Florida (New York: Benchmark Books, 2005), pp. 10-14 He became a soldier and fought against the Moors in Granada. He was probably with Christopher Columbus on his second voyage. He eventually became a soldier and fought against the Moors in Granada. Like other conquistadores, Ponce de Leon soon sought fame and fortune through exploration, and it is believed he began his quest as part of Christopher Columbus's second expedition in 1493. == Hispaniola == Some ten years later he was a Captain under Nicolas de Ovando, the governor of the island of Hispaniola. Ponce de Leon put down a mutiny and was made governor of the eastern province of Hispaniola. Ponce de Leon received a substantial land grant which authorized sufficient Taino slave labor to farm his new estate.Robert H Fuson, Juan Ponce de Leon and the Discovery of Puerto Rico and Florida (Blacksburg, VA: McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company, 2000), pp. 63-65 Ponce de Leon prospered in this new role. He found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby Boca de Yuma. This was where Spanish ships stocked supplies before the long voyage back to Spain. In 1505 Ovando authorized Ponce de Leon to establish a new town in Higuey, which he named Salvaleon. In 1508 King Ferdinand authorized Ponce de Leon to conquer the remaining Tainos and exploit them in gold mining.Irving Rouse, The Tainos- Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1992), p. 155 Around this time, Ponce de Leon married Leonora, an innkeeper's daughter. They had three daughters (Juana, Isabel and Maria) and one son (Luis). The large stone house Ponce de Leon ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of Salvaleon de Higuey. == Puerto Rico and Bimini == In 1508 Ponce de Leon led an expedition to what is now Puerto Rico. They searched for and found gold. After founding a colony there he was appointed governor. == Florida == === First expedition === In 1513, with three ships, Ponce de Leon led an expedition to discover what is now the east coast of Florida. According to tradition, he landed at or near St. Augustine, Florida. He named the place La Florida. This is most probably because he landed during the Spanish Easter celebration called Pascua Florida.Bob Knotts, Florida History (Chicago: Heinemann Library, (C)2008), p. 6 After exploring the coast further, they returned to Puerto Rico. === Second expedition === Ponce de Leon returned in 1521 with 200 settlers. They brought cattle, horses, and what they needed to farm the land. As they were building the settlement they were attacked by local Indians. In the fighting Ponce de Leon received a mortal wound, possibly by a poisoned arrow. The party returned to Cuba where Ponce de Leon died. He was buried in what is now San Juan before the alter of the Dominican church. His remains were later moved to San Juan cathedral. == Fountain of youth == The story of a fountain of youth goes back many centuries. Herodotus (425 - 484 BC) talked about a group he called the Macrobians who lived somewhere in modern day Ethiopia. He said they remained youthful, were physically strong and lived a long time. Calling it a fountain of youth came much later. The stories of Ponce de Leon and his search for a fountain of youth developed after his death. There is no mention of such a goal in any of his orders. In 1535 the Spanish historian Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes first stated Ponce de Leon was searching for a fountain of youth. The legend was repeated by later writers and embellished. == References == Category:Spanish explorers Category:History of Florida

Then it became Glassboro State College in 1958. Starting in the 1970s, it added programs in business, communications, and engineering. It was renamed Rowan College of New Jersey in 1992, after Henry Rowan and his wife Betty gave the school $100 million. At the time, the gift was largest ever given to a public college.Gurney, Kaitlin. "10 years later, Rowan still reaps gift's rewards - Rowan Milestones", The Philadelphia Inquirer, July 9, 2002.

Rowan and his late wife, Betty, gave the money on July 6, 1992, with just one requirement: that a first-rate engineering school be built. In gratitude, Glassboro State changed its name to Rowan College." It became Rowan University on March 21, 1997, when it won approval for university status from the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education.O'Brien, Gina.

Ritornello
Ritornello is an Italian word meaning "little return".Talbot, Michael. "Ritornello." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed December 15, 2015, , http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/23526. At first in music ritornello was used as an instruction to repeat a part. By the 1600's the word was used to describe a part of the music played by instruments in a vocal piece. These instrumental sections could be at the start (a prelude), in the middle (an interlude), or at the end (a postlude). In dramatic music, the ritornello provided an opportunity for dancing, or for a scene change. In the Baroque period, a common way to write a song, called an aria, was in da capo form. The aria would be written as two contrasting sections, A and B. By adding an instrumental ritornello (R), the aria could be developed further, forming the scheme R-A-R-B-R-A-R. In the early 1700's composers began using the ritornello form in concertos, the solo instrument replacing the voice. This gave the composer the chance to develop music during the solos with new material and key changes, between repeated sections of full orchestra. Guiseppe Torelli began using this form, which was then developed and extended by Antonio Vivaldi. Vivaldi's way of using this form has the following features: *Ritornellos for the full orchestra alternate with sections for the soloist or soloists. *The opening ritornello is composed of several small sections. These are usually two to four bars in length, which may be repeated or varied. These sections can be separated from each other or combined in new ways but are still the ritornello. *When the ritornello is used again, it may be only a part, using only one or some of the sections, sometimes varied. *The ritornellos guide the tonal structure of the music. They establish the new key if the music changes keys. The first and last use of the ritornello is in the tonic. One (usually the first to be in a new key) is in the dominant; and others are in closely related keys. Later composers such as Bach and Telemann used Vivaldi's form in their works. ==References== Category:Musical forms
Dominant (music)
The dominant in music is the fifth note of a major or minor scale."Dominant." The Oxford Dictionary of Music, 2nd ed. rev.. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed December 15, 2015, , http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e3044. In a C scale, the fifth and dominant note will be G. Chords built on this note are called dominant chords. In the key of C, the dominant chord will be G-B-D. Keys have the same relationship as notes, so the dominant key will be the key of the fifth note. So in C, the key of G is the dominant key. In musical theory, the dominant is written with the roman numeral "V". ==References== Category:Music theory
Vitus Bering

He went into the service of the Russian navy in 1704. He was commissioned a second lieutenant. During the Great Northern War he distinguished himself and was promoted to the rank of commander. == First Kamchatka expedition == In 1639 a group of Russian promyshlenniki (hunter- traders) sailed from Russia into the Pacific ocean, They were the first Europeans to sailed between Asia and North America.Jennifer Speake, Literature of Travel and Exploration, Vol 2 (New York; London: Fitzroy-Dearborn Publishers, 2003), p. 897 Peter the great, Czar of Russia, wanted to send an expedition to confirm the information. In 1724 he sent the first Kamchatka expedition (1725-30) led by Bering. One of their tasks was to see if Siberia was connected to North America. They sailed first to the Kamchatka Peninsula where a ship was built for the exploration. In 1728 Bering sailed north far enough to discover that Siberia and North America (Alaska) were not connected. == Second Kamchatka expedition == The Second Kamchatka Expedition (1733-43) was a very large scientific expedition. It was also led by Bering. The scientific expedition sent out smaller explorations to chart the coasts of Siberia, the Pacific, and several research expeditions. Ships were sent to Japan and America to promote Russian interests. Bering reached Alaska in 1741. On the return journey they had to stop at Bering Island. While there nearly half the crew, including Bering, died. In 1991, Danish archaeologists found his grave. == References == Category:1681 births Category:1741 deaths Category:Danish people Category:Explorers

Ethiopian calendar
The Ethiopian calendar is the main calendar used in Ethiopia. It serves as the liturgical calendar for Christians in Eritrea and Ethiopia belonging to the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, Eastern Catholic Church and Coptic Orthodox Church. It is a solar calendar which comes from the Egyptian calendar. But like the Julian calendar, it adds a leap day every four years. It begins the year on August 29 or August 30 in the Julian calendar. A seven to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the annunciation of Jesus. == Makeup == Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopic calendar has twelve months of 30 days plus five or six epagomenal days, which make up a thirteenth month.Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, & Culture, Volume 1, ed. H. James Birx (Los Angeles: Sage, 2009), p. 128 The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar. The names of the days are in Ge'ez. The sixth epagomenal day is added every four years without exception on August 29 of the Julian calendar. This occurs six months before the Julian leap day. Thus the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 Maskaram, for years between 1900 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually September 11 (Gregorian). It, however, falls on September 12 in years before the Gregorian leap year. The Ethiopian New Year falls on September 11 of the Gregorian calendar. On leap years it falls on September 12. == History == In 1582 the Christian world changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar.Philip Briggs, Ethiopia (Chalfont St Peter, Bucks: Bradt Travel Guides Ltd, 2015), p. 63 Ethiopia did not make the change. As a result, Ethiopia is seven years and eight months behind those countries that use the Gregorian calendar. Christmas and Easter fall on different dates than they would elsewhere. == Tourists == In Ethiopia banks, airlines and other institutions that tourists would use run on the western calendar. Everywhere else the Ethiopian calendar is used. That may cause some confusion. == Notes == == References == == Other websites == * Current local time and date in Ethiopia Category:Ethiopia Category:Calendars

The Willamette River flows the entire length of the valley. The valley is surrounded by mountains on three sides - the Oregon Coast Range to the west, the Cascade Range to the east, and the Calapooya Mountains to the south. The valley's many waterways are important to the economy of Oregon. They continuously put highly fertile alluvial soils on the valley's broad, flat plain. The valley was widely publicized in the 1820s as a 'promised land of flowing milk and honey'. Throughout the 19th century it was the destination for the oxen-drawn wagon trains of people on the Oregon Trail. Today the valley is home to "Oregon Wine Country".

Indian softshell turtle
The Indian softshell turtle (Nilssonia gangetica), or Ganges softshell turtle is a species of softshell turtle. It lives in rivers such as the Ganges and Mahanadi in India and Bangladesh. Its shell can be up to in length.Ernst, C.H.; Altenburg, R.G.M.; and Barbour, R.W. (1997). Aspideretes gangeticus , Turtles of the World. Retrieved 17 June 2014. It feeds mostly on fish, amphibians, carrion and other animal matter, but also eats aquatic plants. The turtle is listed as a vulnerable species. The turtle has a long neck and a long nose, which means it is able to easily keep the tip of the nose out of the water to breathe. It has an oval shaped shell, which is also fairly flat and smooth which means it is able to swim very fast. These turtles are often kept in the temple ponds of Odisha where they are considered sacred. The Indian softshell turtle is under threat as 30 to 40 tons of turtle meat is sold in markets every week.Nilssonia gangetica | ARKive: Ganges soft-shelled turtle videos, photos and facts - Nilssonia gangetica | ARKive , accessdate: December 21, 2015 The shells are also used to make masks, which are sold to tourists. The turtles' habitat is also being changed by the building of dams, drainage works, and increasing levels of fishing and farming. ==References== Category:National symbols of Bangladesh Category:Turtles of Asia

Diatonic scale
thumb|right|330px|Diatonic scale on C, equal tempered and just . thumb|300px|The modern piano keyboard is based on the interval patterns of the diatonic scale. Any sequence of seven successive white keys plays a diatonic scale. The diatonic scale is one of the scales used in music. It is also called heptatonic scale, because it uses seven distinct pitch classes or tones. For each octave there are five whole steps and two half steps. The two half steps are separated by two or three whole steps. The word "diatonic" comes from the Greek , meaning progressing through tones.Ball, Philip (2010). The Music Instinct, London: Vintage, p.44 The seven pitches of any diatonic scale can be obtained using a chain of six perfect fifths. An example of this would be the seven natural pitches which form the C-major scale. It can be constructed from a stack of perfect fifths starting from F: :F--C--G--D--A--E--B This property of the diatonic scale is called Pythagorean tuning. It was historically relevant and contributed to the worldwide diffusion of diatonic scales, because it allowed musicians to tune musical instruments easily by ear. Any sequence of seven successive natural notes, such as C-D-E-F-G-A-B, and all transpositions, are diatonic scales. Piano keyboards are designed to play natural notes, which are diatonic scales, with their white keys. A diatonic scale can be also described as two tetrachords separated by a whole tone. The term diatonic originally referred to the diatonic genus, one of the three genera of the ancient Greeks. In musical set theory, Allen Forte classifies diatonic scales as set form 7-35. The following scales are diatonic: * Modes, mainly used in Church music * The altered scale, which is widely used for Jazz music * harmonic minor or the melodic minor. Examples of scales that are not diatonic are whole-tone scales, as well as the gypsy scales, which are often used for folk music. ==Other websites== * Diatonic Scale on Eric Weisstein's Treasure trove of Music * The diatonic scale on the guitar ==References== Category:Music theory

thumb|right|300px|Path through the forest immediately north of Bewdley thumb|right|300px| The beautiful moth Oecophora bractella Wyre Forest is a large, semi-natural woodland and forest measuring . It sits across the borders of Worcestershire and Shropshire, England. It is lightly managed. ==Natural history== The forest has a variety of wildlife. It was much larger, but it still is one of the largest remaining ancient woodlands in Britain. The Forestry Commission looks after about half of today's forest. Two-thirds of the forest is a SSSI (1,753.7 hectares), and a further fifth (549 hectares) is a National Nature Reserve. The Dowles Brook flows through the heart of the forest, and the A456 road also runs through the southern edge of the woodland. It is one of the largest areas of semi-natural (partially unmanaged) woodland in the UK. Wildlife species to be found in the forest include hawfinch, fallow deer, dipper, common crossbill, pied flycatcher, redstart, and long-eared owl among many other woodland birds and plants. The small but colourful moth Oecophora bractella has one of its few English populations here, and does not seem to occur much farther northwards. The forest is an important habitat for adders, which have been the subject of a notable study. == References == Category:Forests of the United Kingdom Category:Worcestershire Category:Shropshire

Bronchodilator
thumb|right|300px| A bronchodilator is a substance that dilates (opens up) the bronchi and bronchioles which increases airflow to the lungs. Bronchodilators may be endogenous (originating naturally within the body), or they may be medications taken to treat breathing difficulties. They are most useful in obstructive lung diseases. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common such conditions. They are also used to treat respritory blockages that usaully occur when you have the common cold. They are well prescribed by doctors and are really common in house holds. Although this remains somewhat controversial, they might be useful in bronchiolitis and Bronchiectasis.They are often prescribed but of unproven significance in restrictive lung diseases. == Types of bronchodilators == Bronchodilators are either short-acting or long-acting. Short-acting medications provide quick or "rescue" relief from acute bronchoconstriction. Long-acting bronchodilators help to control and prevent symptoms. They are used along with inhaled steroids for control of asthma symptoms on a long-term basis. The three types of prescription bronchodilating drugs are ?2-agonists (short- and long- acting), anticholinergics (short-acting), and theophylline (long-acting). == Common bronchodilators == The bronchodilators are divided in short- and long- acting groups: === Short-acting bronchodilators === *Salbutamol/albuterol (Proventil or Ventolin) *Levosalbutamol/levalbuterol (Xopenex) *Pirbuterol (Maxair) *Epinephrine (Primatene Mist now withdrawn) *Racemic Epinephrine (Asthmanefrin, Primatene Mist Replacement) *Ephedrine (Bronkaid) *Terbutaline === Long-acting bronchodilators === *Salmeterol (Serevent) *Clenbuterol (Spiropent) *Formoterol *Bambuterol *Indacaterol == References == Category:Drugs

Battle of Cannae
The Battle of Cannae ( or ) was a major battle of the Second Punic War. It took place on 2 August 216 BC in Cannae, Apulia, in southeast Italy. The army of Carthage, under Hannibal, defeated a larger Roman army. The Romans were led by the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro.Christa Steinby, Rome Versus Carthage: The War at Sea (Barnsley: Pen & Sword Military, 2014), p. 133 Hannibal's victory was one the greatest tactical feats in military history. It was also one of the worst defeats in Roman history. After recovering from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to fight Hannibal at Cannae. The Roman army had about 70,000 soldiers.Victor Hanson, Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power (New York: Anchor, 2007), p. 99 The Romans massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual. Hannibal attacked using a double-envelopment tactic.Mark Healy, Cannae 216 BC: Hannibal Smashes Rome's Army (London: Osprey Publishing, 2002), p. 7 This was so successful that the Roman army was destroyed as a fighting force by an army half its size. About 45,500 Roman and allied soldiers were killed. Also killed were 2,700 Roman cavalry. About 17,000 were taken prisoner. Hannibal lost a total of about 4,000 men. Following the defeat, many of Rome's allies changed sides and allied themselves with Carthage.Mark Healy, Cannae 216 BC: Hannibal Smashes Rome's Army (London: Osprey Publishing, 2002), p. 86 == References == Category:210s BC Category:Punic Wars Category:Apulia Category:August events

Egyptian calendar
The ancient civil Egyptian calendar was a calendar used by the ancient Egyptians. At first it had a year that was 365 days long. The year was made up of 12 months each having 30 days. At some point during the First Dynasty five additional days were added (sometime around 3000 BC).Marshall Clagett, Ancient Egyptian Science, Volume 2 (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1995), p. 33 Egyptian astronomers observed that the annual flood of the Nile River fell very close to the first visibility of the star Sirius in the morning sky just before sunrise. This calendar would drift by 1 day every four years. But this drift was not enough to cause any problems.Sacha Stern, Calendars in Antiquity: Empires, States, and Societies (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 133 Even if a person lived to be 60 years old the drift between solar and civil calendars would only be 15 days. In 238 BC the Decree of Canopus added a sixth day every four years to correct this.Jane Sellers, The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt (East Sussex, UK: Gardners Books, 2007), p. 177 But it was largely ignored. In 30 BCE the Roman Emperor Augustus reformed the Egyptian calendar by adding a leap day to every fourth year. This brought the Egyptian calendar in line with the Julian calendar used at the time in Rome. == References == Category:Calendars Category:Ancient Egypt

Cranial nerve
thumb|right|Cranial nerves with labels A cranial nerve is any nerve which is attached directly to the brain or brainstem. This is different from spinal nerves which are attached to segments of the spinal cord. Cranial nerves relay information more directly between the brain and body (mostly parts of the head and neck). Each cranial nerve exists as a pair and is present on both sides of the central nervous system. All cranial nerves appear above the first vertebra in the neck (cervical vertebra). In humans there are twelve cranial nerves pairs. They are numbered using Roman numerals I-XIISometimes. depending on definition, they are listed as 13 nerves. based on their order from the front of the brain to the back, where the brainstem is. ==Function== Cranial nerves provide motor and sensory stimulation mainly to places within the head and neck. This sensory stimulation includes sensations such as temperature, touch, taste, vision, smell, balance and hearing. ===Smell (I)=== The olfactory nerve (CN 1) sends information about smells from the nose up to the brain.Stephen G. Waxman, Ed. Clinical Neuroanatomy, 28e New York, NY: McGraw-Hill In the brain, this information is processed and becomes olfaction, or our sense of smell. The olfactory nerve is an is an afferent sensory nerve, meaning it takes in information from the outside world and sends it to the central nervous system. thumb|Head anatomy with olfactory nerve, including labels for the nasal cavity, olfactory nerves, cribiform plate, olfactory bulb, and olfactory tract ==== Structure ==== The olfactory nerve is the shortest cranial nerve. It is one of two cranial nerves that does not connect to the brain stem, the other being the optic nerve (CN 2).Vilensky, Joel; Robertson, Wendy; Suarez-Quian, Carlos (2015). The Clinical Anatomy of the Cranial Nerves: The Nerves of "On Old Olympus Towering Top". Ames, Iowa: Wiley-Blackwell. The olfactory nerve is not just one nerve, but a group of neurons working together to perform the same task. The olfactory neurons start branched out in the nasal cavity. From here, they reach up through the roof of the nasal cavity and connect to the olfactory bulb. The olfactory nerve is unique because it is the only cranial nerve that can regenerate parts of itself if it is damaged. ==== Path of sensation ==== Smell molecules called aromatics come up the nose and into the nasal cavity. Here, they are detected by olfactory neurons. These neurons are branched out along the lining of the nasal cavity. Olfactory neurons take in the signal from the smell molecules and make electric signals called action potentials. The action potentials move up the olfactory neurons through the roof of the nasal cavity, also known as the cribiform plate. After passing through the cribiform plate, the olfactory neurons send the action potentials to the olfactory bulb. From here, signals are sent through the olfactory tract and out to different parts of the brain. For example, some signals are sent to the frontal lobe, where smells are identified and labeled. Damage to this path can cause anosmia, or loss of the ability to smell. ===Vision (II)=== The optic nerve (CN II) transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. ===Eye movement (III, IV, VI)=== The oculomotor nerve (CN III) controls most of the muscles related to the movement of the eye, including the eyelids and control of the pupil. The trochlear nerve (CN IV) and abducens nerve (CN VI) are each responsible for their own single eye muscles. ===Facial sensation, jaw movement (V)=== The trigeminal nerve (CN V) is called "trigeminal" because it is made of 3 parts. Together, all these parts are responsible for sensation in the face and larger facial movements such as biting and chewing. ===Facial expression (VII)=== The facial nerve (CN VII) controls the muscles of facial expression, and helps carry taste sensations from the back of the tongue and mouth. ===Hearing and balance (VIII)=== The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) transmits sound and equilibrium (balance) information from the inner ear to the brain. ===Oral sensation, taste, and salivation (IX)=== The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is a mixed nerve that carries a wide range of sensory and motor information. ===Control of heart and digestion (X)=== The vagus nerve (CN X) allows for parasympathetic control of the heart and digestive tract. It is the longest nerve of the autonomic nervous system in the human body. ===Shoulder elevation and head-turning (XI)=== The accessory nerve (CN XI) is a cranial nerve that controls the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. ===Tongue movement (XII)=== The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) is involved in controlling tongue movements required for speech and swallowing. == Routes out of the brain == After leaving the brain, the cranial nerves travel inside the skull. Some must leave this bony compartment to reach their destinations. Often the nerves pass through holes in the skull, called foramina. Other nerves pass through bony canals, longer pathways enclosed by bone. These foramina and canals may have more than one cranial nerve, and may also contain blood vessels. == Related pages == * Neuron * Central nervous system * Brain stem == References == Category:Anatomy of the nervous system

Fetal alcohol syndrome
thumb|right| Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a group of mental and physical problems that can happen when a mother drinks alcohol while she is pregnant. A "syndrome" is a group of symptoms. "Fetal" means anything that has to do with a fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome includes ways a fetus is hurt by alcohol while it is still in its mother's womb. ==Cause== Fetal alcohol syndrome is caused by a mother drinking alcohol while she is pregnant. When a mother drinks while she is pregnant, the alcohol goes through the umbilical cord to the fetus. This is why doctors say "when a [pregnant] woman drinks alcohol, so does her baby." Alcohol is poisonous to a fetus and can cause brain damage. This can cause many other problems once the baby is born. Alcohol can cause problems with the way the fetus develops at any time during a pregnancy. This includes the earliest part of pregnancy, when the mother might not even know she is pregnant. A fetus is most likely to develop fetal alcohol syndrome if its mother: * Binge drinks (has four or more drinks in a short time), even once; and/or * Drinks a lot, regularly It does not matter whether the mother drinks beer, wine, hard liquor, or any other kind of alcohol. One kind is not safer than any other. They are all equally likely to cause FAS. ==Diagnosis== To be diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, a child must have problems in three different areas. ===Abnormal facial features=== Having "abnormal facial features" means that parts of the child's face look different than a child without FAS. To be diagnosed with FAS, a child must have: ** A smooth space between the nose and upper lip; ** A thin upper lip; and ** Eyes that are wide apart ===Growth problems=== Children with FAS do not grow as well as children without FAS. These growth problems can start even before birth, so many babies with FAS are born weighing less than other babies. To be diagnosed with FAS, a child must have a height, weight, or both that are lower than normal. Their height or weight must be in the 10th percentile or lower, meaning 90% of all other children are taller or heavier. ===Central nervous system problems=== The central nervous system controls everything in the body. When it is damaged by alcohol during pregnancy, the damage can cause many different problems. To be diagnosed with FAS, a child must have three different kinds of central nervous system problems: ====Structural problems==== "Structural" problems are problems with the shape of the head or the brain. For example: * The child's head may be smaller than what would be normal for their height and weight * Brain scans (like MRIs) may show changes in the shape of the child's brain ====Neurological problems==== Neurological problems are problems with the way the brain and nerves control the body. For example: * Problems with coordination (using different parts of the body together) * Problems controlling muscles * Problems with sucking as a baby ====Functional problems==== "Functional" problems are problems doing everyday tasks. To be diagnosed with FAS, a child has to have a lot more trouble doing everyday things than other children his age. The child has to have a low IQ or developmental delay, or problems in three of these areas: * Cognitive deficits (thinking problems), like trouble learning in school * Executive functioning deficits (problems with the type of thinking that helps us plan, organize, and solve problems) * Motor functioning delays (problems with how a person controls their muscles), like: ** Having trouble walking (this is an example of a gross motor skill) ** Having trouble writing (this is a fine motor skill) ** Having trouble with balance and coordination (using different parts of the body together) * Attention problems or hyperactivity (having trouble paying attention and having lots of energy) * Problems with social skills, like making friends * Other problems with daily tasks == Prevention == In the United States, alcohol is the most common cause of birth defects that can be prevented. Fetal alcohol syndrome can be prevented in every pregnancy if the mother drinks no alcohol while she is pregnant. Doctors suggest that women who are trying to get pregnant should also drink no alcohol. This is because a woman may not know she is pregnant for the first 4-6 weeks of her pregnancy. Some women drink alcohol during this time, since they do not realize they are pregnant. But drinking during the earliest part of a pregnancy can cause severe FAS because the earliest part of the pregnancy is when the fetus's brain starts developing. This is why it is safest not to drink any alcohol if a woman thinks she might get pregnant. ==References== Category:Syndromes Category:Alcohol drinking habits Category:Disorders Category:Health care
Meridian arc
In geodesy, a meridian arc is the distance between two points with the same longitude. In geometry it is an arc: a segment of a curve. The length of an imaginary rope laid over the globe would be that distance. Two or more such measurements at different places get the shape of the reference ellipsoid which is most like the shape of the geoid. This process is called "the determination of the figure of the Earth". The earliest determinations of the size of a spherical Earth used a single arc. The latest determinations use astro-geodetic measurements and the methods of satellite geodesy to get the reference ellipsoids. The Alexandrian scientist Eratosthenes about 240 BC, first calculated a good value for circumference of the Earth. He knew that on the summer solstice at local noon the sun goes through the zenith in the ancient Egyptian city of Syene (Assuan). He also knew from his own measurements that, at the same moment in his hometown of Alexandria, the zenith distance was 1/50 of a full circle (7.2?). Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene, Eratosthenes concluded that the distance between Alexandria and Syene must be 1/50 of Earth's circumference. In 1687 Newton published in the Principia a proof that the Earth was an oblate spheroid of flattening equal to 1/230.Isaac Newton: Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III, translated into English by Andrew Motte.

Mujaddid
Mujaddid () in Islam is a reformer who is given the task of removing errors that have occurred among Muslims. Their job is to show people the great religious truths which the Muslim community will be asked to face. According to the popular Muslim tradition, it refers to a person who appears at the turn of every century of the Islamic calendar to revive Islam, cleansing it of extraneous elements and restoring it to its pristine purity. In contemporary times, a mujaddid is looked upon as the greatest Muslim of a century. Ikhtilaf (disagreements) exist among vatious hadith specialists. Scholars and historians like Al-Dhahabi and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani have interpreted that the term mujaddid can also be understood as plural, thus referring to a group of people.Fath al-Baari (13/295)Taareekh al-Islam (23/180) The Arabic word mujaddid means "reformer", "renovator", "reviver", "renewer" or "regenerator". It is someone who revives and renovates the religion. The concept of tajdid (renewal or revival) and the term mujaddid come rather from a hadith, a statement of the Prophet Muhammad. This hadith was written down by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, one of the six authoritative Sunni collections of the Prophet's statements. In this hadith, the Prophet says: This means reform is in the essential nature of Islam and Muslims are called all the time to work hard to make new ideas cope with tradition. It also means that not everything in the Muslim tradition is useful and good for this modern age; there are certain things that were possible in the past but are no longer relevant today. Slavery would be a prime example.Islam and modernity: Islamist movements and the politics of position by Said Mentak. == The concept of tajdid in Islamic thought == Tajdid (renewal) in Islamic thought means renewing the ideology representing the intellectual product of Muslims in the fields of science, knowledge and ijtihad to interpret Islam and understand and explicate its rulings. Al-Suyuti mentioned in his book Al-Jami' al-Sagheer, "Renewing religion means renewing its guidance, clarifying its truth and precedence, refuting the innovations and extremism presented to its followers or their reluctance in upholding it, and following its rules in managing the interests of the people and the law of society and civilization." Among the most manifest aspects of tajdid (renewal) in Islamic thought is the renewal of Islamic sciences as follows: # The science of Islamic doctrine. # The Principles of Islamic jurisprudence. # The science of Jurisprudence. # The science of the sunnah. # The science of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir). # The science of Purification and Code of Conduct (Sufism). # The biography of the Prophet and Islamic history. Mujaddids can include prominent scholars, pious rulers and military commanders. ==The reformers in Islam== There is no formal mechanism for designating a mujaddid. The persons of this list are claimed to be Mujaddid. While there is no formal mechanism for designating a mujaddid in Sunni Islam, there is often a popular consensus. ===1th Century AH=== * Al- Hasan al-Basri (21-110 A.H./642-728 A.D.) * Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (63-101 A.H./682-720 A.D.) * Abu Hanifah (80-150 A.H./702-772 A.D.) * Malik ibn Anas (93-179 A.H./711-795 A.D.) ===2th Century AH=== * Muhammad ibn Idris al- Shafi'i (150-204 A.H./767-820 A.D.) * Ahmad ibn Hanbal (164-241 A.H./781-855 A.D.) ===3th Century AH=== * Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (260-324 A.H./873-935 A.D.) * Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (238-333 A.H./852-944 A.D.) * Abu Ja'far al- Tahawi (239-321 A.H./853-933 A.D.) * Ibn Surayj (249-306 A.H./864-918 A.D.) ===4th Century AH=== * Abu Bakr al-Baqillani (338-403 A.H./950-1013 A.D.) * Ibn Furak (330-406 A.H./941-1015 A.D.) * Al-Hakim al-Nishapuri (321-405 A.H./933-1014 A.D.) * Abu Hamid al-Isfarayini (344-406 A.H./955-1015 A.D.) * Abu al-Tayyib Sahl al-Sa'luki (000-404 A.H./000-1013/14 A.D.) * Ibn Hazm al- Andalusi (384-456 A.H./994-1064 A.D.) * Abu al-Ma'ali al-Juwayni (419-478 A.H./1028-1085 A.D.) ===5th Century AH=== * Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (450-505 A.H./1058-1111 A.D.) * Ibn al-Jawzi (509/510-597 A.H./1116-1201 A.D.) * Ahmad al-Rifa'i (512-578 A.H./1118-1182 A.D.) ===6th Century AH=== * Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (543/44-606 A.H./1149-1209 A.D.) * Abu al-Qasim al-Rafi'i (555-623 A.H./1160-1226 A.D.) * Al-Baydawi (000-685 A.H./000-1286 A.D.) * Al-'Izz ibn 'Abd al-Salam (577-660 A.H./1181/82-1262 A.D.) ===7th Century AH=== * Ibn Daqiq al-'ld (625-702 A.H./1228-1302 A.D.) * Ibn 'Ata' Allah al-Sakandari (658-709 A.H./1259-1309 A.D.) * Ibn Battuta (703-779 A.H./1304-1377 A.D.) * Abu Ishaq al-Shatibi (720-790 A.H./1320-1388 A.D.) * Al-Taftazani (722-793 A.H./1322-1390 A.D.) ===8th Century AH=== * Siraj al-Din al-Bulqini (724-805 A.H./1324-1403 A.D.) * Zain al-Din al-'Iraqi (725-806 A.H./1325-1404 A.D.) * Ibn Khaldun (732-808 A.H./1332-1406 A.D.) ===9th Century AH=== * Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti (849-911 A.H./1445-1505 A.D.) * Zakariyya al-Ansari (823-926 A.H./1420-1520 A.D.) * ===10th Century AH=== * Shams al-Din al-Ramli (919-1004 A.H./1513-1596 A.D.) * Khayr al-Din al-Ramli (993-1081 A.H./1585-1671 A.D.) * Ahmad Sirhindi (971-1034 A.H./1564-1624 A.D.) ===11th Century AH=== * Aurangzeb (1068-1118 A.H./1658-1707 A.D.) * 'Abdallah ibn 'Alawi al-Haddad (1044-1132 A.H./1634-1719 A.D.) * Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1114-1176 A.H./1703-1762 A.D.) ===12th Century AH=== * Murtada al-Zabidi (1145-1205 A.H./1732-1791 A.D.) * Ahmad ibn 'Ajiba (1160-1224 A.H./1747-1809 A.D.) * Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlawi (1159-1239 A.H./1746-1824 A.D.) ===Thirteenth Century (November 14, 1882)=== *Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905) *Said Nursi (1878-1960) ===Fourteenth Century (November 21, 1979)=== *Ahmed Raza Khan ( 1865 - 1921) *Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani (1914-1999) == Controversial figures == * Ibn Taymiyyah (661-728 A.H./1263-1328 A.D.) * Usman dan Fodio (1167-1233 A.H./1754-1817 A.D.) * * Al-Albani (1332-1420 A.H./1914-1999 A.D.) ==Notes== == References == * Tuhfat al-Muhtadin bi Akhbar al-Mujaddidin () by Jalal al- Din al-Suyuti. * Mausu'at A'lam al-Mujaddidin fi al-Islam () by Samih Kurayyim. * Mujaddid - Islamic Encyclopedia == Other websites == * Concept of a Mujaddid and the past and present ones Category:Islam Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Religious leaders

thumb|right|300px| Chumar is a place in the provences of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The area is claimed by both China and India. According to China's Ministry of Defence "the two countries' border, to this day, has not been designated". The problem is that for centuries, the sparsely inhabited mountainous region existed as a buffer zone between empires. A border war broke out in 1962 that has to date killed thousands of soldiers. The tension between the two countries has come and gone but is now raised again. == References == Category:Territorial disputes of India Category:Jammu and Kashmir
The Song of Roland
The Song of Roland () is an epic poem based on the Battle of Roncevaux in 778 during the reign of Charlemagne. It is the oldest surviving major piece of French literature. It exists in different manuscript versions which shows its great popularity in from the 12th to 14th centuries. The date of poem is somewhere between 1040 and 1115. An early version began around 1040. Additions and changes were made up until about 1115. The final text has about 4,000 lines of poetry. These are further divided into 298 poetic units called laisses. It was written to be performed, possibly to music. The author of the poem is unknown. The epic poem is the oldest example of the chanson de geste. This was a literary form popular between the 11th and 15th centuries. It was all about legendary deeds and heroes. == Historical event == The poem is about an actual historical event that happened centuries earlier. In 778 Charlemagne invaded Spain. On his way through the Pyrenees he looted and plundered Basque lands. He found little resistance in Spain until he reached the city of Zaragoza. Charlemagne demanded they surrender. The city governor, Hussain Ibn al-Ansari, refused. Charlemagne then laid siege to the city but with little success. Finally the governor paid Charlemagne a large amount of gold in return for Charlemagne's army leaving the area. Charlemagne had a pending Saxon revolt at home so he needed little persuasion to leave. As Charlemagne marched north back to France he again passed through Basque territory. His large army was deep in the Pyrenees in a long column on August 15, 778. His rearguard was commanded by Roland, one of Charlemagne's most trusted leaders. The rearguard was attacked starting the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. The Basques using their knowledge of the terrain were able to overcome the Frankish rearguard. But their job was to protect the main army so they fought to the last man. The Basques plundered the baggage trains and captured the gold Charlemagne was paid at Zaragoza. Before the Frankish army could turn to fight the Basques, they had gone. Roland and his men died as heroes. ==Main characters in the poem== *Baligant *Blancandrin *Bramimonde *Charlemagne *Ganelon *King Marsile *Naimon *Oliver *Roland *Turpin ==References== == Other websites == *Song of Roland Category:Poems

Apgar score
thumb|Virginia Apgar The Apgar score is used in medicine. It is a quick way of measuring how healthy a newborn baby is. Virginia Apgar invented the Apgar score in 1952. She was an anesthesiologist, and created the score to measure how babies were affected by anesthesia given to their mothers during childbirth. Today, the Apgar score is very commonly used by doctors, nurses, midwives, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and other medical professionals. One of the reasons it is so popular is that doing an Apgar test is very quick. It usually takes less than a minute, sometimes just seconds. When an Apgar test is done, five simple things about the newborn baby are checked. The newborn gets a score of 0, 1, or 2 on each of these give things. The scores are added up, and the total is the newborn's Apgar score. "Apgar" is the name of the woman who invented the Apgar scale. But "APGAR" is also a backronym that stands for the things the Apgar scale checks. These are Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration. ==The Apgar score== {| class="wikitable" !What is Being Checked? !Score of 0 !Score of 1 !Score of 2 |- ! Appearance (of the skin) |Blue all over (cyanosis)||Blue at arms and legs Body is pink (acrocyanosis)||No cyanosis Pink all over |- ! Pulse (Heart rate) |0 (none)||Under 100 beats per minute||Over 100 beats per minute |- ! Grimace (Irritability) |Does not respond to stimulation (rubbing or flicking the newborn) |Grimaces (frowns) with a lot of stimulation |Cries when stimulated |- ! Activity |None (not moving)||Limp muscles||Pulls back strongly when an arm or leg is pulled on |- ! Respiration |None (not breathing)||Breathing under 40 times per minute Breathing is weak, gasping, or grunting||Breathing over 40 times per minute; or crying strongly |+ The five things that make up the Apgar score: |} ==What the scores mean== The Apgar test is usually done one minute after birth, and again five minutes after birth. It may be repeated later if the score is low and stays low. The main goal of the Apgar score is to see whether the newborn needs medical help. Usually: * Scores of 7 or more are normal, and the newborn only needs basic care. * Scores of 4, 5, and 6 are low. The newborn may need some medical help, like being warmed up or being given oxygen. * Scores of 3 or below are dangerously low. The newborn may need immediate medical help, like CPR or help breathing. ===Low scores=== If a newborn has a low Apgar score one minute after birth, this does not mean the baby is going to have long-term health problems. This is especially true if the Apgar score is better five minutes after birth. But an Apgar score that stays below 3 at later times--like 10, 15, or 30 minutes after birth--may show that the newborn has brain damage. These newborns are a little more likely to have cerebral palsy. However, the Apgar test cannot predict (say for sure) whether a baby will have long-term health problems. ==References== ==Other websites== * (Retrieved from Profiles in Medicine-The Virginia Apgar Papers) Category:Medicine Category:Babies
Double Falcon
Double Falcon (also possibly Dju and Nebwy) was a Predynastic pharaoh of Lower Egypt belonging to Dynasty 0. The exact timeline of his reign is unknown, although it is estimated to be during the 33rd century BCE. The length of his reign is unknown. == Discovery == In 1910 M. J. Cledat, an Egyptologist, discovered the first evidence for king Double Falcon. A farmer at el-Mehemdiah in the north-eastern delta brought him a jar and some incised fragments found while planting a palm-grove in nearby el-Beda. Cledat soon discovered four serekhs of king Double Falcon.M. J. Cledat, Les vases de el-Beda, ASAE 13 (1914), pp. 115-121Kaiser-Dreyer, in: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archaologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo. (MDAIK) 38 (1982), Deutsches Archaologisches Institut, Orient-Abteilung, p. 9. In 1912 Hermann Junker found a tomb at Tura, which contained a complete jar with a serekh topped by two falcons. More serekhs of king Double Falcon have been found in the Sinai,Gunter Dreyer, Ein Gefass mit Ritzmarke des Narmer, in: MDAIK 55, (1999), pp. 1-6 in Tell Ibrahim Awad in the eastern delta,E. C. M. van den Brink, Pottery-incised Serekh-Signs of Dynasties 0-1, Part II: Fragments and Additional Complete Vessels, in: Archeo-Nil 11, 2001 in Adaima and Abydos in Upper Egypt,Eva-Maria Engel: Ein weiterer Beleg fur den Doppelfalken auf einem Serech, Bulletin of the Egyptian Museum, 2 (2005), pp. 65-69. and in the Palmahim quarry in southern Israel. Because these finds have mainly been in Lower Egypt and north-western Sinai, it shows Double Falcon may have only ruled over these areas. However as some of his serekhs have been found in Upper Egypt and Canaan, it shows that the power of the Dynasty 0 kings was spreading. This had already begun towards the end of the Naqada III period, through trading or warfare. == Name == The serekh of Double Falcon is unique. Firstly, it is the only one topped by two Horus falcons, facing each other. Secondly, the serekh does not have a place for the name. Instead this space is filled by vertical lines which usually represent the niched facade of a palace. The serekh does not have the horizontal line that separates the palace facade from the name of the ruler above. Finally, each falcon stands on its own peak. Experts believe that these features are symbolic. The two falcons could represent Lower Egypt and the Sinai, as it seems that Double Falcon reigned over both regions. Dreyer believes that the falcons stand on a on a sign meaning "mountain" which is N26 of Gardiner's sign list: N26 He reads the name as Dju (), so that the name of the king is shown by a pair of falcons on mountains above a plain serekh. But another expert, van den Brink, reads the name as Nebwy (), meaning "the two lords", and similar to a much earlier palette on display in the Barbier-Mueller Museum of Geneva.Image of the paletteEdwin van den Brink: The Pottery-Incised Serekh-Signs of Dynasties 0-1.

Cocaine withdrawal
Cocaine withdrawal happens when a person who uses a lot of cocaine stops using cocaine. It can also happen when a person who uses a lot of cocaine starts using less cocaine than they did before. Cocaine (also called coke) is a powerful stimulant. It is an illegal drug outside of hospital usage. It makes people feel very happy, talkative, energetic, and not want to eat as much food. ==Side effects of cocaine== Cocaine's most dangerous side effects include: * Increased body temperature (high fever) * Irregular heart rate or rapid heart rate * High blood pressure * Increased risk of heart attack * Strokes * Sudden death from cardiac arrest * Sudden aggression * Sudden very bad paranoia * Feeling, seeing, or hearing things that are not really there (hallucinations), including feeling like there are insects under the skin (this is called formication or coke bugs) ==Withdrawal effects of cocaine== After using cocaine regularly, some users will become addicted. When a person who is used to using cocaine stops right away, they will go through what is called a "crash" along with many of other cocaine withdrawal symptoms, like: * Paranoia * Depression * Exhaustion (feeling very tired) * Anxiety * Itching * Mood swings (quick changes in emotions) * Irritability (feeling easily annoyed) * Fatigue (feeling tired), sleeping many hours * Insomnia (trouble sleeping) * A very strong craving for more cocaine * Nausea and vomiting. Some cocaine users also report having similar symptoms to schizophrenia patients and feel that their mind is lost. Some users also report formication: feeling like things are crawling on the skin (also called, "coke bugs" or "spiders"). These symptoms can last for weeks or, in some cases, months. Even after many withdrawal symptoms go away, most users feel like they need to keep using cocaine. This feeling can last for years and may get worse during times of stress. About 30-40% of cocaine addicts start using other kinds of drugs or alcohol after they stop using cocaine. ==Treatment== ===Therapy=== Twelve-step programs like Cocaine Anonymous (modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous) have been widely used to help people addicted to cocaine. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Therapy (MT) have proven to be more helpful than 12-step programs in treating cocaine dependency. However, both of these approaches have a fairly low success rate. Ibogaine has been researched a treatment for cocaine dependency. It is used in clinics in Mexico, the Netherlands, and Canada, but it cannot be used legally in the United States. Non-drug treatments like acupuncture and hypnosis have been studied. However, these studies have not clearly shown that acupuncture or hypnosis helps with cocaine withdrawal. Cocaine addiction continues to be the second-most difficult addiction to manage, behind heroin addiction. ===Medications=== Medications that have been studied to treat cocaine withdrawal include acetylcysteine, baclofen, bupropion, vanoxerine, and vigabatrin. Kim Janda has been working for years on a vaccination that would treat cocaine use disorders. The anti-depressant desipramine, and the stimulants methylphenidate and pemoline, have been used to treat cocaine dependence in people who also have a mental illness. Several drugs have been used to treat cocaine withdrawal and cravings: * The anti-convulsant drug carbamazepine (Tegretol); * Medicines which increase the amount of dopamine in the brain, like L-DOPA/carbidopa * Amino acids * Tyrosine * Tryptophan Finally, drugs have been used to cause an "aversion reaction" (a very bad reaction) when given with cocaine. The most common of these drugs is phenelzine. ===Reward-based treatments=== On February 14, 2011, two Swiss psychologists published two years' research on cocaine addiction. They found that addicts who gambled were less likely to use cocaine or to relapse on cocaine. They think gambling may refocus the brain's "reward center" from cocaine to gambling. They said that psychotherapy should be used along with gambling. More research is being done on long-term relapse rates (the number of people who eventually start using cocaine again). However, a more recent study looked at prize-based contingency management: a treatment method that offers addicts chances to win prizes if they do not use cocaine. This study found that prize-based contingency management helped cocaine addicts stay off cocaine, whether or not they had gambled recently. This suggests that it is the chance of a reward, not the gambling itself, that helps cocaine addicts stay off of cocaine. ==References== Category:Addiction

Serekh
A serekh was an important type of heraldic crest used in Ancient Egypt. thumb|159x159px|Serekh of Khasekhemwy depicting both the Horus animal wearing the white crown (left) and Seth animal wearing the red crown (right) above the king's name == Appearance == Serekhs, particularly those found throughout Egyptian history, are typically composed of three components: a recessed or niched facade, the king's name inscribed in a panel, and a falcon. While both the facade and name depictions are consistent in history, during a portion of Egyptian history there appears variety among the animal incarnation specified. This can be seen by the falcon being presented singularly, joined alongside a Seth chimera, completely replaced by the Seth, or absent of both. Prominent examples include the mid-Dynasty II's ruler Peribsen whose serekh exclusively displays the Seth animal and his predecessor, Khasekhemwy, whose serekh joins both falcon and Seth animal.Emery, Walter Brian. 1961. Archaic Egypt. Harmonds- worth: Penguin. Dissecting these components, it appears each element serves a purpose in its iconography of kingship. The recessed or niched facade, which appears at the bottom of the serekh, is often considered associated with the king's ownership of large building such as a palace or tomb. This rendition would serve both to certify the king's authority but also to acknowledge his possession of wealth. The panel, which exists between the niched facade and the falcon, is observed as the space where the king's name is written. It's underlying purpose is often debated, however, some claim it to be an allusion to early architectural elements such as the false doors in many pharaonic tombs. On top of this panel, as stated earlier, is often a falcon denoting the god Horus. Horus's presence in the serekh suggests the name inscribed in the panel as being the king's Horus name, but the god's association with kingship often lends credibility to the monarch. Both the Seth and Horus animals can be shown wearing a red, white, or double crown of Egypt and in some instances, appear in control of weapons. Such personification indicates the larger role played by the serekh, and potentially the use of the animal god as a representation of the king. The king himself would often be known to contain or exemplify the 'Ka' of Horus, which was the internal spirit that was later removed following the kings death and transitioned to fill that of the succeeding king. This retention of a godly spirit would be then be used as the deciding testament for the kings right to the throne. This relationship between the king's Ka and the Horus god in royal serekh's can be traced to many of the earliest texts and coalesce with the development of early writing.Quirke, Stephen. 1990. Who Were the Pharaohs? London: British Museum Publications. Until Dynasty IV, serekhs served as the only means for royal identification and later become secondary to the cartouche. The name depicted in the panel is denoted as the king's Horus name- in the case that the Horus animal is depicted- and is a tribute to the belief that kings were considered son of the god Osiris and therefore a semi-divine earthly representation of Horus. This name, which is one of five great names, is further argued to be the king's Ka name. The characterization of the Horus falcon also provides a means of dating serekhs and further identifying their owner. For instance, Horus's represented in crouching positions is a distinguishing trademark of Dynasty 0 and First Dynasty serekhs. Additionally, the presence of a concave top below the Horus symbol, rather than straight, suggests a date no later than the reign of king Aha. After Dynasty 2, the previously broad falcon tail is also redesigned to become more narrow and straight.Hamilton, Caleb R. "Mapping Evidence for Early Dynastic Activity in the Dakhleh Region." Proceedings of the Ninth International Dakhleh Oasis Project Conference: Papers Presented in Honour of Anthony J. Mills, edited by Gillian E. Bowen and Colin A. Hope, by Bruce E. Parr et al., IX, Oxbow Books, Oxford; Philadelphia, 2019, pp. 171-180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv138wsg1.16. The word "serekh" comes from the Egyptian word for "facade". There are many different serekhs on different types of objects. Many different decorations and details of the facade are shown in many different examples. It seems that there were no strict rules for the design of the serekh.Jurgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der agyptischen Konigsnamen. Munchner Agyptologische Studien. Bd. 49. Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1999, , p. 7-9.Rolf Gundlach: Horus in the Palace: The centre of State and Culture in pharaonic Egypt. In: Rolf Gundlach, John H. Taylor: Egyptian royal Residences: 4. Symposium zur Agyptischen Konigsideologie (4th edition, London 2004). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2009, , p. 45-68.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt: Strategy, Society and Security. Routledge, London 1999, , p. 56-57, 201-202. == Use == A serekh was normally used as a royal crest, showing the name of the pharaoh. They have been found as far back as the predynastic Naqada II (Gerzean) period (ca. 3400 BC.). The hieroglyphs forming the king's name were placed inside a rectangular area above the serekh. From the Old Kingdom period onward, the word serekh appears in old papyri. A serekh was not only important in validating the authority of the king during his time of rule, but it subsequently allowed fallen kings to maintain a legacy long after death. In the time of ancient Egypt this was especially important as the adoption of a name signified the beginning of one's existence. This connection between name and existence was so well established that often it was not uncommon for the serekh of a royal to stand in his place. This is captured by the many serekhs exhibiting arms and hands attached to either the falcon animal or the panel element wielding weapons or holding captives. This personification of serekhs suggests an active participance in its surroundings and therefore its role as embodiment of the inscribed king. This anthropomorphizing of glyphs and symbolic images, such as the catfish glyph on an ivory cylinder of Narmer which epitomizes the duality of function, continues throughout Egyptian history and can be seen in a variety of contexts.Dochniak, Craig C. 1991. Kingship Festival Iconography in the Egyptian Archaic Period. (MA dissertation, University of Arizona). Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International. It is seen most noticeably in the serekh's of king Aha where the falcon god Horus yields a weapon within the confines of the serekh.Ikram, Salima, and Corinna Rossi. "An Early Dynastic Serekh from the Kharga Oasis." The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, vol. 90, 2004, pp. 211-215. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3822252. Given the predominant usage of serekhs in the identification of kingship, especially preceding Dynasty IV, the presence of such also serve to demonstrate Egyptian presence in foreign areas. Inscribed serekhs into natural stone sites provide compelling evidence of travel or expansion of Egyptian populations into such areas. == Placement == Serekh's appear on a variety of surface throughout history, progressing alongside the material industry current at the time. Most noticeably appearing on statues and landmarks, they also sit on the likes of many less elaborate medium such as rock or pots.Kaplony, Peter. 1963. Inschriften der Agyptischen Fruhzeit. 3 vols. AgAbh 8/1-3. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz. These less precious materials, however, simultaneously exhibit reduced precision and detail of incised serekhs compared to those on more esteemed material such as alabaster. Additionally, names included within serekhs are often short-handed on pottery vessels. Frequently in rock art, such as on stone massifs, serekhs are accompanied by other pictorial hieroglyphs or artistic scenes. The style of artwork placed alongside the serekhs also serves to help date illegible or damaged components. == Images == File:Serekh of Amenemhat VII.jpg|Serekh of Amenemhat VII inscribed into steatite cylindrical seal File:Djer 1.jpg|Serekh of Djer carved into an ivory label found at Abydos File:Horus name of Shoshenq V, incised above Nekhbet and Wadjet.

Tuskegee syphilis experiment
thumb|right|350px| The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment (/t?s'ki:gi:/) was a clinical study. The study was done between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service. Its goal was to study how syphilis progressed (got worse) if it was not treated. The study's subjects (the people who were being studied) were poor African American sharecroppers. They were told that they were receiving free health care from the U.S. government. This experiment is infamous because none of the men being studied were told that they had syphilis. Even after the 1940s, when doctors realized that penicillin could cure syphilis, the men were not given this cure, or any other treatment. The men were not told that they were not getting real treatment, or that a cure was available. This study raised many important questions about medical ethics. ==Background== In the 1930s, when the study started, syphilis was a very serious health problem in the United States. In fact, syphilis had been a serious health problem throughout all of history. Syphilis gets worse over time. It can be very painful. If it is not treated, it causes brain damage and death. In the 1930s, there was no cure for syphilis. The treatments that were used did not work well and some were poisonous. Doctors did not understand syphilis. Because of this they did not have any way to help people with the disease. There had been very few studies done on how syphilis affected people. One study was done in Norway in 1928, but it studied only white men. In the 1930s, people believed that syphilis affected people of different races in different ways. Doctors thought that African Americans' cardiovascular system was more affected by syphilis than the central nervous system.Murphy, Timothy F. "The Tuskegee Syphilis Studies," in Case Studies in Biomedical Research Ethics. Cambridge: MIT, 2004. 21. Print. The Tuskegee study group decided to study how syphilis affected African Americans. They reasoned that they could not cure or treat people with syphilis anyway, and that they would learn things that would help doctors understand syphilis better. ==The experiment== ===Beginnings=== The Public Health Service started working on the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in 1932 during the Great Depression. Tuskegee University, a college in Alabama that was open to African-American students, also helped with the study. They helped because they thought the study would improve public health for poor people in the area. For the study, researchers signed up a total of 600 African American men from Macon County, Alabama. A total of 399 of these men had syphilis before the study began. The remaining 201Center for disease control and prevention did not have syphilis. (In research, this healthy group is called a "control group"). Researchers wanted to compare the difference between people with and without syphilis. The men were given free health care, meals, and free burial insurance for being in the study. The researchers' original goal was to study the effects of syphilis for just six months. At first, they studied the men in the experiment for six to eight months. They were then given the only treatments that were known at the time. These included arsphenamine (which is now used as a chemotherapy), ointments made of mercury and bismuth. These treatments were all very poisonous. Some treatments helped a little while others made things worse. ===Money for treatment=== The Tuskegee study received money to treat the men in the study from the Rosenwald Fund. This was a major organization from Chicago whose purpose was philanthropy. Specifically, they supported improving black education and developing communities in the South. In 1928, the Rosenwald Fund had worked with Public Health Services in a study of over 2,000 black workers in Mississippi's Delta Pine and Land Company. The study's goal was to see how common syphilis was in this group. The Rosenwald Fund helped provide treatment for 25% of the workers who had tested positive for syphilis. However, in 1929, the Stock Market Crash happened. The Great Depression also began. The Rosenwald Fund said they could no longer pay for medicine to treat the Tuskegee men. ===The study continues without treatment=== After funding (money) for treatment was lost, the study was continued. The study's subjects were never told that they would never get treatment. In fact, the men were told they were being treated for "bad blood." "Bad blood" was a local word that people used to describe different diseases, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. Researchers started using tricks and lying to the men in the study, without caring about medical ethics or the men's rights. For example, researchers wanted to do lumbar punctures ("spinal taps") on the men to measure the effects of syphilis. These spinal taps were dangerous and very painful. To make sure that the men would come get the spinal taps, the researchers sent all 400 subjects a letter titled "Last Chance for Special Free Treatment." This was a lie; the spinal taps were not treatment. All of the study's participants also had to have an autopsy after death in order to receive funeral benefits (money given to their families to pay for a funeral). After penicillin was discovered as a cure in the 1940s, researchers did not give penicillin to any study participants. They also did not tell any of the participants about penicillin. Many patients were lied to and given placebo treatments so that researchers could keep studying how syphilis affected the men. The researchers did this even though they knew that without treatment, the syphilis would eventually kill the men. ===Researchers keep patients from getting treatment=== During World War II, 250 of the Tuskegee men registered for the draft. These men were given medical exams by the military, and were diagnosed as having syphilis. They were ordered to get treatment for syphilis before they could be taken into the military. But the Tuskegee study's researchers tried to keep these men from getting treatment. A Public Health Service worker was quoted at the time saying: "So far, we are keeping the known positive patients [the men with syphilis] from getting treatment." By 1947, penicillin had become the normal treatment for syphilis. It was not just a treatment, but a cure. The United States government created several public health programs to help people get the cure. The government formed "rapid treatment centers" where people could go for penicillin. The governments goal was to eradicate syphilis (to make it not exist any more). But when these programs came to Macon County, study researchers kept the Tuskegee men from participating. ===End of the study=== The study continued until 1972, when Peter Buxton, who also worked for the Public Health Service, gave information about the experiment to a reporter. This caused the study to end, on November 16, 1972. By that time, all of the Tuskegee men with syphilis had gotten no real treatment for 40 years. By the end of the study in 1972, only 74 of the test subjects were alive.Allan M. Brandt, 'Racism and Research: The Case of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study', Hastings Center Magazine (December 1978), Reprinted Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, United States Navy Of the original 399 men, 28 had died of syphilis. Another 100 were dead of related complications. A total of 40 of their wives had been infected and 19 of their children were born with congenital syphilis. == Related pages == * Syphilis * Medical ethics * Penicillin ==References== Category:Public health Category:Research methods

Carolingian dynasty
thumb|right|200px| The Carolingian dynasty was a Frankish noble family who ruled over a large part of western Europe from 751 to 987. They were a line of mayors, kings, and princes who succeeded the Merovingian dynasty. The most famous member of the family was Charlemagne. The dynasty was named after Charlemagne's grandfather, Charles Martel. He was a Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia and Neustria.Pierre Riche, The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe (Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), pp. 36-37 The mayors of the palace were the real power behind the throne. Charles Martel (meaning "the hammer") left his wealth and power to his two sons, Pepin III and Carloman. In 771 Carloman died leaving his half to Pepin who became Mayor of the Palace.Einhard the Frank; Notker; Balbulus, Two Lives of Charlemagne, ed. Lewis G. M. Thorpe (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1983), pp. 56-58 When the last of the Merovingian kings, Childeric III, was deposed by the Pope in Rome, Pepin was made king of the Franks. Pope Stephen III traveled to France and placed the crown on his head.World Monarchies and Dynasties, ed: John Middleton (London; New York: Routledge, 2015), p. 150 Pepin left the kingdom to his two sons, Charles and Carloman. Charles and his brother shared the kingdom for some time. Carloman then traveled to Rome and became a monk. Charles became the sole king. He then earned his name "Charles the Great" (Charlemagne) by defeating the Lombards, the Saxons, and the Avars. In 800 Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III. The dynasty was passed down to his son, Louis the Pious and to his grandsons. By the time Louis inherited the kingdom the Carolingian Empire had already started to decline. By the end of the 9th century it came to an end. With the collapse of the empire the dynasty came to an end. == References == Category:Frankish rulers Category:Royal dynasties

Tension pneumothorax
A tension pneumothorax is when air builds up inside the chest. So much air builds up that one or both lungs may collapse. This causes serious breathing problems. Also, the air in the chest pushes on the heart and other important parts of the body, and causes other serious problems. If it is not treated quickly, a tension pneumothorax will kill a person. ==How does a tension pneumothorax happen?== A tension pneumothorax usually happens because of an injury to the chest. For example, a knife or gunshot wound will cause a hole in a person's chest. Air then gets sucked in through that hole. The air starts to build up. It pushes on the lungs. If the knife or gun has also caused a hole in the person's lung, air will leak out of the lung. That air will also build up in the chest. When enough air is pushing on the lung, the lung will collapse. A tension pneumothorax can also happen because of other kinds of chest injury, like from a car accident or a fall. When a person gets injured this way, there may not be any hole in his chest. But inside the body, the person may be bleeding badly. Instead of air, blood builds up in the chest. It pushes on the lung and makes it collapse. This is called a hemothorax. ==What happens as a tension pneumothorax gets worse?== Once a person's lung collapses, they will have trouble breathing. As air or blood keeps building up in the chest, the person's symptoms will keep getting worse. The air or blood in the chest will push against and squeeze the heart. This can cause serious problems. If the heart is squeezed too much, it cannot fill with blood very well. This means it does not have enough blood to pump to the rest of the body. Every part of the body needs blood to survive. If the heart cannot pump enough blood to the body, other parts of the body can start to die. Pressure in the chest can also squeeze the vena cavae, the big veins that bring blood from the body back to the heart. If the vena cavae are squeezed too tightly, blood will not be able to get into the heart. This means the heart will not have enough blood to pump to the lungs or the rest of the body. If a person bleeds enough into their chest, they can go into shock and die from blood loss. If enough pressure builds up in the chest, the other lung can collapse, too. If both lungs have collapsed, there will be no way for the person to breathe. ==Symptoms== A tension pneumothorax will cause some other symptoms. For example: * Mediastinal shift. This means that everything in the mediastinum - the space between the heart and the lungs - will get pushed to one side by the air or blood in the chest. For example, a medical professional will be able to see that the trachea (windpipe) is pushed to one side. In medicine, this is called tracheal deviation or tracheal shift. * Jugular vein distention (JVD). This means that the big veins in the neck will be filled with blood. They will look big and full. This happens because blood cannot get to the heart through the vena cavae, because they are being squeezed too hard, so the blood backs up into the veins in the neck (the jugular veins). * Bulging intercostals. The muscles between the ribs may get pushed out because of the pressure inside the chest. * Unilateral breath sounds. When a medical professional listens to the lungs with a stethoscope, they will be able to hear breath sounds - the sounds of air going in and out of the lungs - only on one side. They will hear nothing on the side where the lung has collapsed. ==Treatment== A tension pneumothorax always needs emergency medical treatment. If a person may have a tension pneumothorax (or has any bad injury to the chest), 911 or another emergency telephone number should be called right away. The emergency medical dispatcher will be able to explain how to help the person until an ambulance gets there. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) or paramedics may give these treatments for a tension pneumothorax: * Give the person oxygen * Put something occlusive over the hole in the chest to keep air from getting through. Examples of things that can be put over chest wounds are plastic wrap, aluminum foil, a hand with a medical glove on it, or special sticky plastic bandages (called occlusive dressings). These will keep more air from getting in through the hole in the chest. They also keep even more pressure from building up in the chest. * Put a hollow needle into the person's chest so air can get out through the needle. This is called a needle decompression. At the hospital, a patient with a tension pneumothorax will be given a chest tube. This is a tube that is placed into the chest so that air or blood can get out and does not build up inside. If the person has bled a lot into their chest, they may also get blood transfusions. ==Related pages== * Pneumothorax * Lungs ==References== Category:Medical emergencies Category:Respiratory system

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), previously known as multiple organ failure (MOF), Total organ failure(TOF) or multisystem organ failure (MSOF), is when the organ function is acutely ill and the patient is required medical intervention to achieve homeostasis. It usually involves two or more organ systems. The use of "multiple organ failure" or "multisystem organ failure" should be avoided since that phrase was based upon physiological parameters to determine whether or not a particular organ was failing. Intensive Care Medicine by Irwin and Rippe ==Cause== The condition usually results from infection, injury (accident, surgery), hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism. The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Sepsis is the most common cause in operative and non-operative patients. Sepsis may result in septic shock. ==Stages== Four clinical phases have been suggested: *Stage 1 the patient has increased volume requirements and mild respiratory alkalosis which is accompanied by oliguria, hyperglycemia and increased insulin requirements. *Stage 2 the patient is tachypneic, hypocapnic and hypoxemic; develops moderate liver dysfunction and possible hematologic abnormalities. *Stage 3 the patient develops shock with azotemia and acid-base disturbances; has significant coagulation abnormalities. *Stage 4 the patient is vasopressor dependent and oliguric or anuric; subsequently develops ischemic colitis and lactic acidosis. ==References== ==Other websites== * The ICU Book by Marino * Cecil Textbook of Medicine * The Oxford Textbook of Medicine * Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine Category:Organ failure Category:Medical emergencies

Aloha was also a box office bomb and only made $26.3 million from its $37 million budget. The Hollywood Reporter estimated that the movies financial losses were close to $65 million by the time the movie ended its run in theatres. The movie was criticized by Media Action Network for Asian-Americans for "whitewashing" the cast. Director Cameron Crowe said in a response: "I have heard your words and your disappointment, and I offer you a heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice. As far back as 2007, Captain Allison Ng was written to be a super-proud one quarter Hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one. A half-Chinese father was meant to show the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent in Hawaii. Extremely proud of her unlikely heritage, she feels personally compelled to over-explain every chance she gets. The character was based on a real-life, red-headed local who did just that." Emma Stone said that whitewashing was a problem in Hollywood and that she regretted being miscast. == Cast == * Bradley Cooper as Brian Gilcrest * Emma Stone as Captain Allison Ng * Rachel McAdams as Tracy Woodside * Bill Murray as Carson Welch * John Krasinski as John "Woody" Woodside * Danny McBride as Colonel "Fingers" Lacy * Alec Baldwin as General Dixon * Bill Camp as Bob Largent * Michael Chernus as Roy * Jaeden Lieberher as Mitchell * Danielle Rose Russell as Grace * Edi Gathegi as Lieutenant Colonel Curtis * Bumpy Kanahele as himself ==References== == Other websites == * Category:2015 comedy-drama movies Category:2015 romantic comedy movies Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:2010s English-language movies Category:Movies directed by Cameron Crowe

Crested serpent eagle
thumb|right|150px| The crested serpent eagle (Spilornis cheela) is a medium- sized bird of prey. It is found in forested habitats across tropical Asia. It is found in a wide range across the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia. There are a number of variations and some authorities prefer to treat several of its subspecies as completely separate species. In the past, several species including the Philippine serpent eagle (S. holospila), Andaman serpent eagle (S. elgini) and South Nicobar serpent eagle (S. klossi) were treated as subspecies of the Crested serpent eagle. == Physical description == All members within the species complex have a large looking head with long feathers on the back of the head giving them a crested appearance. The face is bare and yellow joining up with the beak. Its powerful feet are unfeathered and heavily scaled. They fly over the forest canopy on broad wings and their tails have wide white and black bars. They call often with a loud, piercing and familiar three or two-note call. == Behavior == This raptor sits motionless from a high perch watching for prey. When prey is found it drops almost straight down to pounce. They often feed on snakes, giving them their name and are placed along with the Circaetus snake-eagles in the subfamily Circaetinae. In addition to snakes it catches reptiles as well as small mammals and birds. It will take a dead snake whenever it finds one. They are often seen soaring over their territory in pairs. In Japan they are usually found very close to forest edges and wet marshlands. == Role in the ecosystem == Crested serpent eagles are apex predators and at the top of their food chain. They are a good indicator of the health of the ecosystem they occupy. They control snake populations and also those of other small mammals and reptiles. They are a common sight in places such as India. The species is not globally threatened. On most lists they are of least concern. == References == Category:Accipitriformes Category:Birds of China Category:Birds of India Category:Birds of Indonesia Category:Birds of Pakistan Category:Least concern species

Naan
Naan bread is a type of bread made with flour. It is a flatbread that is baked in a tandoor. Naan bread often looks like a tear drop. It is often covered in herbs and spices such as garlic to change the taste. Naan bread is made from basic bread ingredients like wheat flour, a leavening agent (either yeast, yogurt, baking powder, or all), salt, and butter or ghee. It also is made with yogurt and milk. The yogurt is what makes naan bread taste so much different than other kinds of bread. == Gallery == File:Cheese Naan.jpg|Indian cheese Naan File:Naan shiva.jpg|Naan bread in Indian restaurant Shiva. == Related pages == * Bread Category:Indian food Category:Flatbreads
Clothes dryer
thumb|right|250px| A clothes dryer or tumble dryer is a machine that is used to remove water from clothing after it is washed. A dryer has a rotating cylinder called a "drum' that holds clothes and lets hot air in to evaporate the water. Then the heated air and water vapor exit through a vent. The drum spins so that the clothing stays apart making the hot air work better. Dryers can use electricity to both operate the machine and create heat to dry the clothes. Others use natural gas to create the heat. Ventless clothes dryers work differently since they cannot vent the hot air. The two types of ventless dryers are condensation dryers and heat pump dryers. Condensation dryers heat the air the same as a regular dryer, but use a heat exchanger. The air is cooled and the water goes down a drain. A heat pump dryer works similarly but passes the air a heat pump. The water either goes down the drain or into a collection tank. == References == Category:Home appliances Category:Clothing

File allocation table
A file allocation table (FAT) is a way that computers look up stored data on a storage device. These include floppy disks, USB flash drives, SD cards and other high capacity storage devices. A FAT is a list of clusters that show where a computer file is stored. These clusters are not necessarily right next to each other but can be scattered over the disk or storage medium. The FAT is always located in the first few clusters of a storage device.There are always two identical copies, one being a backup of the other. The FAT file system is a legacy file system that is both simple and robust. It works well even in lightweight uses. But it cannot deliver the same speed, reliability and scalability as some modern file systems. It is, however, supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed operating systems for personal computers. It is also supported by many mobile devices and embedded systems. That makes it a well suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981 up to the present. == History == It was originally designed in 1977 for use on floppy disks. FAT was soon adapted and used almost universally on hard disks throughout the DOS and Windows 9x eras for two decades. As disk drives improved, the capabilities of the file system have been extended accordingly. This has resulted in three major file system variants: FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while generally preserving backward compatibility with existing software. With the introduction of more powerful computers and operating systems FAT is no longer the default file system for use on Microsoft Windows computers. == Modern use == FAT file systems are still commonly found on floppy disks, USB sticks, flash and other solid-state memory cards. DCF uses FAT as the standard file system for digital cameras. FAT is also utilized in the boot stage of EFI-compliant computers. == References == == Other websites == * File Allocation Table; YouTube * FAT * FAT File Systems, Microsoft Category:Computer file formats

Esperanto alphabet
The Esperanto alphabet is the alphabet which is used to write the Esperanto language. It has 28 (twenty-eight) letters. {|class="wikitable" style="text- align:center; table-layout:fixed" |+ Esperanto alphabet ! Number ||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||11||12||13||14||15||16||17||18||19||20||21||22||23||24||25||26||27||28 |- !

IPA phoneme |||||||||||||||||||||||||=||||||||||||||||||||||||||=|||| |} The Esperanto alphabet is based on the Roman alphabet (which the English alphabet is also based on). Unlike the English alphabet, it does not have the letters q, w, x or y, but it has 6 (six) letters that use a diacritic (a special mark above a letter): c, g, h, j, s and u. == Alternative writings == Because Esperanto uses letters with diacritics, there was (and sometimes still is) the need to write text in Esperanto even if the special letters are not available. L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, proposed the so-called h-system (h-sistemo in Esperanto). Instead of diacritics, the letter h is added, with the only exception being u. For example, g becomes gh, h becomes hh and u becomes u. Words which appear to have a diacritic but do not actually can be "broken" with a hyphen or an apostrophe. For example, flughaveno (airport) becomes flug-haveno or flug'haveno. Another system used to replace diacritics is the x-system (x-sistemo in Esperanto). The letter x is not used in the Esperanto alphabet, but it can be used to write diacritics. The x-system, unlike the h-system, does not treat u differently from the other letters. For example, g becomes gx, h becomes hx and u becomes ux. flughaveno remains the same, as there is no ambiguity. == Unicode and HTML == The whole Esperanto alphabet is part of the Latin-3 and Unicode character sets, and it is included in WGL4. The code points and HTML entities for the special Esperanto characters in Unicode are: {| class="wikitable Unicode" border="1" |- ! Character ! Description ! Code Point !

(Dead link). Available in The letters c, g, h, j are not used in any other language in the world. According to some people, the phonetic system of Esperanto is too similar to the Polish dialect of Bialystok, home town of Zamenhof. Several people consider using the Latin alphabet not to be neutral. In fact, many native languages on each continent (except for Antarctica) use the Latin alphabet to write: for example, German (Europe), Swahili (Africa), Vietnamese (Asia), Tahitian (Oceania), Cree (North America) and Apalai (South America). == References == Esperanto Category:Esperanto

Qualia
Qualiasingular form: quale is a term philosophers use for bits of perception or subjective, conscious experience. It is in the field called the philosophy of psychology, or philosophy of mind.Online papers on qualia , by various authors, compiled by David Chalmers Examples of qualia include the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the perceived redness of an evening sky. It is a separate bit of experience, different from thinking about propositions or stream of consciousness thought. Daniel Dennett (b. 1942), American philosopher and cognitive scientist, says qualia is "an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us". == References == Category:Philosophy Category:Consciousness
Stream of consciousness
Stream of consciousness refers to the flow of thoughts in the conscious mind. It was a term used by the American psychologist and philosopher William James in 1890.James, William 1890. The principles of psychology. New York, Henry Holt. James the entire chapter IX to "The stream of thought". James said: :"Consciousness, then, [is not] chopped up in bits. Such words as 'chain' or 'train' do not describe it fitly as it presents itself in the first instance. It is nothing jointed; it flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described". (James, p239) The idea (but not the term) had been noted before James, by the philosopher William Hamilton in his lectures of 1838/9. He described thought as "a series of acts all... connected".Hamilton, William 1859/61. (Henry L. Mansel and John Veitch eds) Lectures on metaphysics and logic. Edinburgh. A similar idea occurs in early Buddhist writings,In the Digha Nikaya. See Steven Collins, Selfless persons; imagery and thought in Theravada Buddhism. Cambridge University Press, 1982, page 257. and is sometimes called the mindstream. == Related pages == *Consciousness *Thought *Qualia *Stream of consciousness writing == References == Category:Psychology Category:Philosophy Category:Metaphors Category:Consciousness

It has very many subscribers. In late summer of 2010, Kissie tried to start a career in music by recording a song, called "Success". It was released a month later. However, the song didn't get very much attention, and most of her readers didn't buy the song. That caused the website that sold "Success" to shut down two weeks after it's publicity. In autumn 2010, Kissie and her friend were traveling to a Swedish city called Vasteras, where they were going to host DJ at a nightclub. She said on her blog that she would meet her readers at the train station, but when she got there, she was attacked by some readers who threw some eggs and flour at her. ==References== Category:Swedish entertainers Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Bloggers Category:Swedish television personalities Category:Swedish writers
Pina colada
thumb|right|150px| A pina colada is a special kind of mixed cocktail. It is usually made of rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. It is usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, a maraschino cherry, or both. Pina colada is the national drink of Puerto Rico. There are many claims to be the first to invent the pina colada. Bartender Ramon "Monchito" Marrero is claimed to be the inventor over fifty years ago by the Puerto Rican government. But there are three places in Puerto Rico that claim to be the home of the Pina Colada. There was also a version made in Cuba as early as 1922. == References == Category:Cocktails
Honda CR-V
The Honda CR-V is a compact SUV, manufactured since 1997 by Honda. It was loosely based on the Honda Civic. It debuted in Japan in 1996. In 1997 the five-passenger compact utility vehicle was introduced in North America. At first it was available only as a four-wheel drive model. It was powered by a 126-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Honda first began producing the CR-V in Sayama, Japan, and Swindon, UK, for worldwide markets. It added North American manufacturing sites in East Liberty, Ohio, in 2007; El Salto, Jalisco, Mexico, in late 2007; and Alliston, Ontario, Canada, in 2012. The CR-V also is produced in Wuhan (Hubei province) for the Chinese market by the Dongfeng Honda Automobile Company. They are a joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Corporation. The CR-V is Honda's second smallest utility vehicle, slotting between the smaller HR-V and the larger Pilot. In 2015 the CR-V was named Motor Trend SUV of the year. == References == CRV
Griot
thumb|right|250px| A griot or Jeli is a West African historian, storyteller, musician, genealogist, spokesperson, diplomat, teacher, praise-singer and more. There is really no word in the English language that fully explains what a Griot does. Not every griot does all these things, but these are some examples of what their function is. == Their role == A griot was a public servant, an artist, and a royal counselor.Africa and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History, Volume 3, eds. Richard M Juang; Noelle Morrissette (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2008), p. 482 His fate depended on the prosperity and survival of the king or queen he served. He preserved the oral history of his tribe or people. In the Caribbean and the Americas he was the link to their African culture and history. The griot was the only person that could keep their past history in Africa alive. Troubadour and poet, diplomat and diviner only begin to describe his functions. Each clan, village, and warrior-family had a griot.Encyclopedia of African American History, ed. Leslie Alexander (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010), p. 48 They kept track of all births, marriages, deaths, battles and other tribal histories. Griots were also said to have the ability to see one's future. They could memorize the history of every member of a clan or tribe going back for centuries. == Who could become a griot == The position of a griot was traditionally passed down from father to son. A griot was born into and trained by a griot family.The Routledge Companion to Actors' Shakespeare, eds. John Russell Brown; Kevin Ewert (London; New York: Routledge, 2012), p. 174 For those not born into griot families, sometimes there was a master griot who taught the arts associated with the position. Today there are state-sponsored and private schools that teach griot arts. But they focus on the musical aspects and not the verbal skills. == Notes == == References == == Other websites == * Griot Tradition * What is a Griot? * Griots and Storytellers.

Synthetic cannabis
thumb|A bag of Spice brand synthetic cannabis Synthetic cannabis (synthetic marijuana) is a type of designer drug made from chemicals sprayed onto herbs. Synthetic cannabis is often called K2, Spice, or fake weed. "Synthetic" means "man-made"; Cannabis is the plant that marijuana is made from. Synthetic cannabis is not really man-made marijuana. It has no marijuana, and no chemicals from the Cannabis plant, in it. Instead, it is sprayed with man-made chemicals called cannabinoids. In the brain, they act like the chemicals in real marijuana (like THC). Because of this, they can make a person feel "high" the same way real marijuana can.www.emed-journal.com Lapoint J, Nelson LS. Synthetic Cannabinoids: The Newest, Almost Illicit Drug of Abuse. Emergency Medicine 2011;43(2):26-28 ==Safety== Medical research has shown that synthetic cannabis is much more dangerous than regular marijuana. For example, one research study found that people who used synthetic cannabis were 30 times more likely to get emergency medical treatment than people who used regular marijuana. Synthetic cannabinoids can also cause much more serious symptoms and health problems than regular marijuana. These problems can include: * Hypertension (high blood pressure) * Cardiac arrhythmias * Heart attack * Stroke * Seizures * Kidney damage * Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not really there) * Psychosis (in some users, this has lasted for weeks after they stop taking the drug; in one person it lasted seven months) * Panic attacks * Violent behavior Research, and the experiences of people who try to stop taking synthetic cannabis, show that it causes addiction and withdrawal symptoms in some people. Professor John W. Huffman, who first created many of the chemicals used in synthetic cannabis, has said: "People who use it are idiots. You don't know what it's going to do to you." ==Legal issues== Synthetic cannabis has had a complicated legal history. Its makers have used many different strategies to keep their products from being illegal. For example, synthetic cannabis is often sold in packages that call it "herbal incense." Most of the packages also have a warning label that says "Not for human consumption" (not for humans to put into their bodies). By doing these things, companies that make synthetic cannabis can say that they are not selling drugs, and it is not their fault if people ignore their warning label. It has also been difficult for states and countries to make synthetic cannabis illegal because there are so many different cannabinoids. For example, in 2009, the United Kingdom made all the cannabinoids that existed illegal. However, scientists quickly created new versions of cannabinoids, which were not listed as illegal in the U.K.'s laws. Like many other countries, the United Kingdom has tried to ban every new cannabinoid as soon as it is created, but new ones are made all the time. Most countries in Europe, and a few countries in Asia, have made some or all synthetic cannabinoids illegal. ===United States=== Before 2010, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) had made some of the cannabinoids used in synthetic marijuana illegal in the U.S. Other cannabinoids were not illegal. Some states passed laws on their own, to make synthetic cannabis illegal in their states. However, before 2010, not all cannabinoids were illegal in the United States. On June 6, 2010, a teenager from Iowa named David Mitchell Rozga killed himself. His friends said they and Rozga had smoked synthetic cannabis about an hour before he shot himself. Rozga's suicide, and the idea that it might have been caused by synthetic cannabis, was reported in newspapers and media all over the world. After Rozga's suicide, the DEA used "emergency powers" to make five cannabinoids often found in synthetic marijuana illegal. Also, after the suicide, United States Senator Chuck Grassley suggested a law called the "David Mitchell Rozga Act." This law would make using or selling synthetic cannabis illegal. The law was passed by the United States Congress in June 2011. On July 10, 2012, President Barack Obama signed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 into law. It made the most common chemicals used in synthetic marijuana illegal. == Related pages == * Marijuana * Designer drugs * THC (the chemical that synthetic cannabinoids try to imitate) == Other websites == * Easy-to-Read Drug Facts (in Simple English) ==References== Category:Illegal drugs Category:Cannabis
Ostwald process
The Ostwald process is a chemical process for making nitric acid (HNO3). The Ostwald process provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production. It is closely associated with the Haber process. It is named after Wilhelm Ostwald, who developed the process and patented it in 1902. Ammonia is converted to nitric acid in two stages. 1) It is oxidized in the presence of platinium as catalyst at about 900 degrees Celsius to form nitric oxide and water. 4 NH3 (g) + 5 O2 (g) -> 4 NO (g) + 6 H2O (g) 2) Nitric oxide is oxidized again to form nitrogen dioxide and then it reacts with water to form dilute nitric acid whereas some portion of the nitrogen dioxide is reduce back to nitric oxide. 2 NO (g) + O2 (g) -> 2 NO2 3 NO2 (g) + H2O (l) -> 2 HNO3 (aq) + NO (g) * Alternatively if the nitrogen dioxide reacts with oxygen. 4 NO2 (g) + O2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) -> 4 HNO3 ==References== Category:Chemical processes

Johnson, and Jimmy Carter) to hide their true identities. The movie got mixed and positive reviews from critics. It has a 68% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four. In his review, he wrote that "Bigelow is an interesting director for this material. She is interested in the ways her characters live dangerously for philosophical reasons. They aren't men of action, but men of thought who choose action as a way of expressing their beliefs." A remake was released on December 25, 2015 and received negative reviews. == Cast == * Patrick Swayze as Bodhi * Keanu Reeves as FBI Agent Johnny Utah * Gary Busey as FBI Agent Angelo Pappas * Lori Petty as Tyler Endicott * John C.

Irma Grese
Irma Ida Ilse Grese (7 October 1923 - 13 December 1945) was a member of the Schutzstaffel (SS), a powerful Nazi military organization, during World War II. She was a guard at the Nazi concentration camps at Ravensbruck and Auschwitz. She was also the warden of the women's part of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.The Times; The Belsen trial; 18 September 1945; pg6 Grese was nicknamed "the Hyena of Auschwitz" () by prisoners there because of the cruel ways she treated them. After World War II ended, Grese was put on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. She was convicted of crimes against humanity for the things she did at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. She was executed in 1945 at age 22. ==Early life== Irma Grese was born in Germany in 1923. In 1936, when Grese was 13, her mother killed herself by drinking hydrochloric acid, a poison, after finding out that her husband had an affair (a relationship with another woman). Grese's father probably joined the Nazi Party in 1937, and got married again in 1939. When she was 14, Grese quit school. By then, she was a member of the League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Madel), a Nazi group for girls. ==Concentration camp guard== Grese volunteered to work in a concentration camp. In 1942, when she was 19 years old, she started working as a guard at Ravensbruck, a concentration camp for women. In March 1943, she was sent to work at Auschwitz-Birkenau. After a year, Grese was promoted to Rapportfuhrerin - warden - at Bergen-Belsen. This was the second-highest rank that a woman could reach. In this job, she helped choose which prisoners would be killed in the concentration camp's gas chambers. When British soldiers were getting close to Bergen-Belsen to liberate it (take it over and free its prisoners), Grese and some other people in the SS decided not to run away. They were captured by the British on 17 April 1945, and taken to prison. In her famous memoir called Five Chimneys, Olga Lengyel (who had been a prisoner in a camp where Grese worked) wrote about how Grese acted there. Lengyel wrote that Grese liked hurting prisoners, making them afraid of her, and choosing which ones would be killed in the gas chambers. ==Trial and execution== Grese was put on trial for war crimes at the "Belsen Trial." Instead of having one big trial with hundreds of defendants, the Nuremberg Trials were separated into smaller trials. For example, people who were accused of committing crimes at Bergen-Belsen were put on trial at the Belsen Trial. Grese was tried there with 44 other people. Her trial lasted from September to November 1945. She was given a lawyer named Major L. Cranfield. Grese was accused of treating prisoners in ways that were illegal because of an international law called the Third Geneva Convention. People who had been prisoners in the camps Grese worked at talked about how Grese murdered and tortured prisoners. They said she especially liked to hurt women. They talked about how Grese beat prisoners, let her dogs attack them, whipped them, and shot them. They said she liked to whip women's breasts, and then make the camp doctor, Gisella Perl, do surgery on the women's breasts without anesthetic, because she liked watching them suffer. Two other female guards were tried at the Belsen Trial. However, Grese was the only woman to get the death penalty. On Thursday, 13 December 1945, in Hamelin Jail, Grese was executed by hanging. ==Related pages== * The Holocaust * Nazi concentration camps ==References== Category:1923 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Executed German people Category:Executed Nazis Category:German war criminals Category:Holocaust perpetrators Category:People executed by hanging Category:SS people

Mustafa al-Maraghi
right|thumb|Mustafa al-Maraghi Muhammad Mustafa al-Maraghi (1881-1945; ) was an Egyptian modernist reformer and rector of al-Azhar in the 1930s. He was one of the students of Muhammad 'Abduh. He called for social, legal and educational changes and pursued a strong campaign - begun by Muhammad 'Abduh and finished by Mahmoud Shaltout - to include the modern sciences in al- Azhar's curriculum.The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (Oxford Reference) To that end he organised committees to reform the university's regulations and curriculum and created a supervisory department for research whose responsibilities included publishing and translation. Mustafa al-Maraghi was the link between the reforms of his mentor Muhammad Abduh and such subsequent leaders of al-Azhar as Mustafa Abd al-Raziq, Abdel-Halim Mahmoud and Mahmoud Shaltout. As a reformer, al-Maraghi believed in Islam's flexibility and ability to adapt to the needs of modernity. He called for the exercise of ijtihad (independent reasoning/interpretation), reinterpretation, and opposed taqlid (imitation or emulation), the blind following of tradition. And he attributed the religious, moral, intellectual, and political decline of Islamic peoples to the adherence to taqlid and the lack of ijtihad. He said that after the first three centuries, ijma' (consensus of the Muslim community or scholars for resolving legal questions) was impossible, because scholars were so scattered in the East and West that usually it was not possible to collect their opinions.Islam and the Modern Age - Volume 27 - Page 166. == References == Category:1881 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Egyptian Muslims Category:Religious leaders

Sonderkommando photographs
thumb|320px|alt=photograph|No. 282 (cropped): Women being led to the gas chambers The Sonderkommando photographs are four blurry pictures, taken secretly in August 1944 inside the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.Georges Didi-Huberman, Images in Spite of All: Four Photographs from Auschwitz, University of Chicago Press, 2008; first published as Images malgre tout, Les Editions de Minuit, 2003. The photographs were taken by a prisoner in Auschwitz II-Birkenau. This was Auschwitz's extermination camp - a place where people were sent to be killed in gas chambers. These are some of the only known photos that show what happened around the gas chambers.Franziska Reiniger, "Inside the Epicenter of the Horror - Photographs of the Sonderkommando" , Yad Vashem: "Among the millions of photographs that are related to Nazi death camps, only four depict the actual process of mass killing perpetrated at the gas chambers in Auschwitz-Birkenau." The photographer was a member of the Sonderkommando, a group of inmates forced to work in and around the gas chambers. He took two photos from inside one of the gas chambers and two from outside. To keep from being caught, he had to aim the camera from his hip and was not able to focus the camera. The Polish resistance (a movement of Polish people fighting against the Nazis) snuck the camera film out of the camp in a toothpaste tube.Didi-Huberman 2008, p. 16. The photographs were numbered 280-283 by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum.Dan Stone, "The Sonderkommando Photographs", Jewish Social Studies, 7(3), Spring/Summer 2001, (pp. 132-148), p. 143, n. 3. Numbers 280 and 281 show the cremation of dead bodies in a fire pit. Number 283 just shows trees (since the photographer could not see where he was aiming the camera, he aimed too high for this photo). Number 282 shows a group of naked women just before they went into the gas chamber.Didi-Huberman 2008, p. 117. ==Taking the photographs== thumb|alt=photograph|No. 280, framed by the gas chamber's doorway or window thumb|alt=photograph|No. 280 cropped Nobody knows for sure who took the photographs. Many records say he was called "Alex," and was a Jewish inmate from Greece. "Alex" may have been Alberto Errera, an officer from the Greek navy; he was shot and killed after hitting an SS officer.Dan Stone, History, Memory and Mass Atrocity, Vallentine Mitchell, 2006, p. 16.For Errera's details, Greif 2005, p. 375, n. 2; Steven B. Bowman, The Agony of Greek Jews, 1940-1945, Stanford University Press, 2009, p. 95; Shlomo Venezia, Inside the Gas Chambers: Eight Months in the Sonderkommando of Auschwitz, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 90ff. (The SS - Schutzstaffel - were the Nazi military organization that ran the concentration camps.) Other members of the Sonderkommando in the camp's crematorium helped get and hide the camera Alex used. They were also look-outs (they watched the SS to find the safest time for Alex to take the pictures.)Stone 2001, p. 132. One of these men was Alter Fajnzylberg, who had worked the camp's crematoria since July 1943.Jean-Claude Pressac, Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers, Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, 1989, p. 124. He once described how the photos were taken: [S]omewhere about midway through 1944, we decided to take pictures secretly to record our work ... In order to do that, [we needed] to get a good camera and film ... From the very beginning, several prisoners from our Sonderkommando were in on my secret: Szlomo Dragon, his brother Josek Dragon, and Alex, a Greek Jew whose surname I do not remember. On the day on which the pictures were taken ... Some of us were to guard the person taking the pictures. In other words, we were to keep a careful watch for the approach of anyone who did not know the secret, and above all for any SS men moving about in the area. At last the moment came. We all gathered at the western entrance leading from the outside to the gas-chamber of Crematorium V: we could not see any SS men in the watchtower overlooking the door from the barbed wire, nor near the place where the pictures were to be taken. Alex, the Greek Jew, quickly took out his camera, pointed it towards a heap of burning bodies, and pressed the shutter. This is why the photograph shows prisoners from the Sonderkommando working at the heap. One of the SS was standing beside them, but his back was turned towards the crematorium building. Another picture was taken from the other side of the building, where women and men were undressing among the trees. They [were going] to be murdered in the gas-chamber of Crematorium V.Janina Struk, Photographing the Holocaust: Interpretations of the Evidence, I. B. Tauris, 2004, p. 114. The film was snuck out of the camp by the Polish resistance. It was hidden inside a tube of toothpaste by Helena Danton, who worked in the SS canteen (camp store). Attached to the film was a note dated 4 September 1944, asking that the film be developed right away. The Sonderkommando photographs were one in many acts of resistance against the Nazis and the war crimes they committed during the Holocaust. ==Related pages== * Sonderkommando * The Holocaust * Auschwitz concentration camp ==References== ==Other websites== *Nathan Cohen, "Diaries of the Sonderkommando," in Yisrael Gutman, Michael Berenbaum (eds.), Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp, Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 522ff.

United States Forest Service
The United States Forest Service (USFS) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that administers the nation's 154 national forests. They also manage 20 national grasslands, which encompass . Major divisions of the agency include the National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Business Operations, and the Research and Development branch. Managing approximately 25% of federal lands, it is the only major national land agency that is outside the U.S. Department of Interior.GAO, "Federal Land Management: Observations on a Possible Move of the Forest Service into the Department of the Interior", February 11, 2009 == History == In 1876, Congress created the office of Special agent in the Department of Agriculture to find out the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. Franklin B. Hough was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed Division of Forestry. The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as "forest reserves," managed by the Department of the Interior. In 1901, the Division of Forestry was renamed the Bureau of Forestry. The Transfer Act of 1905 transferred the management of forest reserves from the General Land Office of the Interior Department to the Bureau of Forestry. It was from that time on known as the United States Forest Service. Gifford Pinchot was the first United States Chief Forester in the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. Significant federal legislation affecting the Forest Service includes the Weeks Act of 1911, the Multiple Use - Sustained Yield Act of 1960, P.L. 86-517; the Wilderness Act, P.L. 88-577; the National Forest Management Act, P.L. 94-588; the National Environmental Policy Act, P.L. 91-190; the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act, P.L. 95-313; and the Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act, P.L. 95-307. In February 2009, the Government Accountability Office decided whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already includes the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, managing some of public land. == References == Category:United States Department of Agriculture Category:United States government agencies Category:1905 establishments in the United States Category:Forestry

White-bellied sea eagle
The white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), is also known as the white-breasted sea eagle. It is a large daytime bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is closely related to Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands. It is a distinctive bird, with a white belly, white head, breast, under-wing coverts and tail. The upper parts are grey. The black under-wing flight feathers contrast with the white coverts. The tail is short and wedge- shaped as in all Haliaeetus species. Like many raptors, the female is slightly larger than the male, and can be long with a wingspan of up to , and weigh . Immature birds have brown plumage, which is gradually replaced with white by the age of five or six years. Its call is a loud goose-like honking. The bird lives in India and Sri Lanka through Southeast Asia to Australia on coasts and major waterways. It breeds and hunts near water, and fish form around half of its diet. Opportunistic, it eats carrion and a wide variety of animals. Although rated of Least Concern globally, it has declined in parts of southeast Asia. It is ranked as Threatened in Victoria and Vulnerable in South Australia and Tasmania. Human disturbance to its habitat is the main threat. The white-bellied sea eagle is revered by indigenous people in many parts of Australia, and is the subject of various folk tales throughout its range. == References == Category:Accipitriformes Category:Seabirds Category:Birds of Asia Category:Birds of Oceania
Off-road vehicle
An off-road vehicle is generally any type of vehicle which can be used for driving on and off paved or gravel surface. Off-road vehicles generally have large tires with deep, open treads and a flexible suspension.Jay Koblenz, 'Custom Made', Popular Mechanics, Vol. 163, No. 8 (August 1986), pp. 110-112 Off-road vehicles should not be confused with off-highway vehicles. These are not designed to be used on highways and are capable of traveling cross-country over rough land, marsh, swamps, ice or snow. == Many uses == Off-road vehicles have a large following because of their many uses and versatility. Several types of motorsports involve racing off-road vehicles. The three largest "4-wheel vehicle" off-road types of competitions are mud racing, desert racing, and rockcrawling. The most common use of these vehicles is for sight seeing in areas distant from paved roads. The use of higher clearance and higher traction vehicles allows access on trails and forest roads that have rough and low traction surfaces. === Rockcrawling === Rockcrawling is an extreme form of off road driving. Drivers use vehicles anywhere from stock to highly modified to overcome obstacles (usually rocks). In rock crawling, drivers drive highly modified four-wheel drive vehicles such as trucks, Jeeps, and "buggies" over very harsh terrain. Driving locations include boulders, mountain foothills, rock piles, mountain trails, etc. Rock crawling is about slow-speed, careful driving. Rock crawlers often drive up, down and across obstacles that would appear impassable. Such vehicles to rock climb are primarily 4x4s. Rock crawling competitions range from local events to national series. A rock crawling competition consists of obstacle courses that are about 100-200 yards long. Each obstacle is set up with gates, similar to a ski course. == Tread Lightly! == In the United States and elsewhere off-road vehicles should be ridden only on roads, trails and areas open to off-road travel. At the request of the United States Forest Service, Tread Lightly! created the "RIDE ON" program reminding off-roaders to "RIDE ON Designated Routes". This was to prevent unregulated motor vehicle travel on public lands. Most US states and other Federal government agencies have similar laws and regulations to safeguard the environment. Tread Lightly!s message of traveling only on existing roads or trails is also designed to prevent social conflicts such as having entire areas closed to off-road travel. == References == Category:Land vehicles
RAM Rebel truck
thumb|300px| The Ram Rebel is a full-size pickup truck made by FCA US LLC (formerly Chrysler Group LLC). The Rebel is a new model for 2015. It has a new grille and tailgate which are different than the regular Ram Trucks. The Ram 1500 Rebel is not just a decal package. It is designed for use both on-road and off-road. The Rebel has features that are standard that would otherwise have to be added by the owner for off-road performance. == Features == The Rebel is available only in the 1500 (half-ton) truck series. It features a blacked-out grille with a large "RAM" letter badge. It stands out as being very different from the RAM truck's iconic "cross-hair" design grilles. Standard equipment includes an off-road powder coated front bumper, skid plates, tow hooks and fog lights. It has projector headlamps with LED marker lights. The aluminum sports hood is distinct to the Rebel. thumb|200px| The Rebel is standard with an air suspension that rides higher than other RAM 1500s. It has new 17-inch aluminum wheels with black accents. It comes with 33-inch (LT285/70R17E) Toyo Open Country A/T all-terrain tires, Bilstein shock absorbers, and has a different steering and stability-control system than a stock RAM. The Rebel is not intended to be a competitor to the Ford Raptor or the RAM Power Wagon although it is often compared to them. == Powertrains == The standard engine in the Rebel is a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine that makes 310 horsepower, 269 pound-feet of torque. It is capable of getting 25 mpg on the highway. The optional V-8 engine is a 5.7-liter HEMI that produces 395 horsepower and 410 pound-feet of torque. It is rated at 15 mpg in the city, 21 mpg on the highway. == References == Category:Pickup trucks
Mahmoud Shaltout
Mahmoud Shaltout or Mahmud Shaltut (1893-1963) () was an Egyptian Islamic jurist and scholar. He was a reformer of al-Azhar, a center of Islamic learning in Cairo. He was the highest religious authority in Egypt during the 1960s. He was received his elementary religious education in Alexandria, Egypt. He then spent many years at al-Azhar University in Cairo. There he rose to become rector of the university. Shaltut was a very active writer on the sharia and on tafsir (explaining texts). Some consider him to be the best example of the intellectual and scholarly project of Imam Muhammad Abduh. He was born in a farming village in Lower Egypt. Shaltut distinguished himself as a student at the religious institute of Alexandria and later at al-Azhar. He became an instructor of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) at al-Azhar in 1927. The following year, the reform-minded Muhammad Mustafa al-Maraghi was appointed shaykh al-Azhar (rector). Shaltut was one of his best supporters. When al- Maraghi was forced out of office the following year, Shaltut continued pressing for reforms. Shaltut himself took many progressive stands. He wanted translating of the Quran. He was in favor of re-establishing relations with Shia Muslims. He suggested sending Azhari students to Europe for graduate studies. He wanted to admit women. He also wanted to add scientific and technical studies to al-Azhar. Yet he survived as a reformer within al-Azhar. This was unlike such former Azhari modernists as Taha Hussein, Ali Abd al- Raziq, and Mustafa Abd al-Raziq, who ended up on the outside. Out of favor with King Faruq, Shaltut helped deliver Azhari support to Nasser against the Muslim Brothers.Cairo University and the Making of Modern Egypt by Donald Malcolm Reid. == His views on Shi'ism == In an effort bring together Sunnis and Shiites worldwide, Shaltut issued a fatwa (religious injunction). It recognized (Twelver) Shiite law as a fifth school alongside the four Sunni schools. He recognized the Ja'fari school of law (called Ithna Ashariyya, or the Twelvers, the largest group in Shia Islam) as one of the five mainstream schools of thought in Islam. This was an important achievement in attempting to unite Muslims around the world. The term "Ja'fari" relates to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 765). Ja'fari became increasingly used during the twentieth century in the efforts to add Shi'ism as a fifth school of law (madhhab) along with the four established Sunni schools. This led to an interview (and later a fatwa) given by the Shaikh al-Azhar Mahmud Shaltut in 1959. Shaltut went as far as declaring that Muslims are free to attach themselves to any of the five schools.R. Brunner, Islamic Ecumenism in the 20th Century: the Azhar and Shiism between Rapprochement and Restraint (Brill, 1996), pp. 289-293.The Shi'a in Modern South Asia: Religion, History and Politics edited by Justin Jones and Ali Usman Qasmi - Page 182. The fatwa of Mahmud Shaltut was published (in 1959) under the title Islam: the religion of unity. It was introduced by two arguments. The historical argument about mutual respect and tolerance between different legal schools of Sunnis as well as the Shi'i school. The other was an argument about the harmful effects of prejudice between Muslim schools of fiqh. It was argued that the spirit of ijtihad had turned into antagonism and they were no longer having discussions. Shaltut feels that all schools of fiqh should be ready to accept from one another. They should accept any idea which follows Islamic principles and that ensures the welfare of family and society. As a first step the Ja'fari school of fiqh was included in the curriculum of al-'Azhar.Modern Islamic Political Thought by Hamid Enayat. == His opinion on apostasy == Shaltut is of the opinion that disbelief in Islam (kufr) is itself not a cause for killing the disbeliever. The apostate should not be killed, since the punishment for apostasy is hellfire and the apostate has no penalty in this world. Mahmud Shaltut believes this based on relevant Qur'anic evidence and concludes that apostasy carries no worldly penalty because it speaks only of punishment in the afterlife.Towards a Civic Democratic Islamic Discourse II Islam State and Citizenship by M.

Automotive lighting
thumb|right|250px| The lighting system of a motor vehicle consists of lighting and signalling devices mounted on the front, rear, sides, and in some cases on the top of a motor vehicle, and lights the roadway for the driver. The lighting system also makes the vehicle more visible, especially in low light conditions. It gives warning to other drivers and pedestrians of a vehicle's presence and direction of travel. Emergency vehicles usually carry distinctive lighting equipment to alert drivers and pedestrians of their rapid movement during an emergency. == History == Vehicles have had lights for well over a hundred years. Candles lit Horse-drawn carriages.Burkard Wordenweber, Automotive Lighting and Human Vision (Berlin; New York: Springer, 2007), pp. 95-96 The first cars, then called horseless-carriages were lit by gas lights. By 1908 electric lighting began to be used on motor vehicles. Red tail lights and yellow brake lights were in use by 1915. Sealed beam headlights were used starting in 1936. By 1940 turn signals were used. Before 1939, headlight design was not standardised. Between 1940 and 1956, all vehicles built in the U.S. were required to have 7'' round headlights (sealed beams). As of 1956 and up, it became possible to install 4 headlights on 1 vehicle (2 lights per 1 side). In 1960 the first halogen lights were used on European cars and the technology came to the US by 1979. Replaceable car light bulbs were in use in the US beginning in 1983. == Lights == *Headlights are for lighting the space in front of the vehicle. Headlights are designed to see as far forward as possible, without "blinding" oncoming cars. Most drivers learn not to "overdrive their headlights". This means not going too fast so your stopping distance is farther than the area lit by the headlights. *Tail lights are red (only) and are lit when the headlights are lit. Modern vehicles are required to have two tail lights. Most tail light assemblies stop lights which warn other drivers that a vehicle is slowing or stopping. They also include the rear *Marker lights and often the turn signals. *Third brake light. Since 1986 in the US and Canada, 1990 in Australia and New Zealand, and in most of Europe since 1998 a third brake lamp mounted higher than the vehicle's two regular stop lights is required. In the United States and Canada since 1986, in Australia and New Zealand since 1990, and in Europe and other countries applying UN Regulation 48 since 1998, a central stop (brake) lamp mounted higher than the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is also required. *Fog lights are optional on many vehicles. Regular headlights reflect light and cause glare when the vehicle is operating in fog. Fog lights are aimed lower to better see the road. They also spread the light out in a wider pattern to aid the headlights in fog, rain, snow or dust. *Driving lights are auxiliary lights designed to help the headlights see farther. They project a narrow beam much farther than headlights usually do. == References == == Other websites == * Dashboard Warning Lights * Emergency vehicle lighting explained Category:Auto parts Category:Automotive technologies Category:Light sources

Theodor Morell
Theodor Gilbert Morell (22 July 1886 - 26 May 1948) was Adolf Hitler's personal doctor. For years, Morell treated Hitler with many different drugs. He helped Hitler with almost everything Hitler did. Morell escaped from Hitler's bunker just a few hours before Hitler killed himself there. ==Life before Hitler== Morell was born in a small village called Trais-Munzenberg, in Upper Hesse, Germany. His family was half Jewish. Morell studied medicine in France. Then he trained in obstetrics and gynecology in Munich, Germany. He became a doctor on 23 May 1913. Morell worked as a ship's doctor for a year. Then, in 1914, when Germany was fighting World War I, he volunteered to be a doctor for the German army. He worked as a doctor in a German army battalion until 1917. By 1918, Morell had opened his own doctor's office in Berlin. He became popular for treating his patients' illnesses in unusual ways. Both the Shah of Persia and the King of Romania asked Morell to be their personal doctors, but Morell refused. In 1920, Morell married Hannelore Moller, a rich actress. ==Being Hitler's doctor== Morell joined the Nazi Party when Hitler became the Chancellor (leader) of Germany in 1933. In 1935, Morell treated Hitler's personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann. Hoffmann told Hitler that Morell had saved his life. In 1936, Hitler met Morell for the first time. Hitler was having very bad stomach pain, and also had a rash on his leg. Morell was able to cure both problems with medicines. After this, Hitler asked Morell to be his personal doctor. Soon, Hitler decided Morell was a medical genius. Morell became one of Hitler's closest friends. Morell began to treat Hitler with a drug he called "Vitamultin" when Hitler felt tired in the morning. Right after he got a shot of Vitamultin, Hitler would feel awake and have a lot of energy. Ernst-Gunther Schenck, a doctor in the SS, had some Vitamultin tested. It had methamphetamine in it. In 1938, Hitler demanded control of part of Czechoslovakia. While Hitler was meeting with the Czechoslovak president, Emil Hacha, Hitler began yelling at Hacha. Hacha became so scared of Hitler that he fainted. Morell injected stimulant drugs into Hacha to wake him up. Morell said these drugs were only vitamins, but they may have included methamphetamine. Soon after Morell gave him the drugs, Hacha agreed to do what Hitler wanted. ===Treating Hitler with drugs=== Morell began treating Hitler with more and more drugs. Most were medicines sold in stores, but some were Morell's own mixes. Many of the things Morell gave Hitler are toxic (poisonous). Because of this, some historians think Morell accidentally made Hitler's bad health even worse. Morell kept a medical diary of the drugs, vitamins and other chemicals he gave Hitler. The diary lists 74 different drugs, in 28 different mixtures. These drugs include psychoactive drugs like heroin, and things sold as poisons. Some of the other drugs Morell gave Hitler were: ==== Drugs that are now illegal in Germany ==== * Amphetamines (called "Pervitin" and "Vitamultin") * Methamphetamine * Cocaine (in eyedrops) ==== Opioid painkillers ==== * Oxycodone (called "Eukodol" or "Eukodal") * Morphine ==== Toxins ==== * Belladonna mixed with strychnine (called "Koster's Antigaspills") * Atropine * E. coli (a bacteria that Morell would take from human feces) ==== Other things ==== * A barbiturate called Brom-Nervacit (almost every night, starting in August 1941) * Sulfonamide, an antibiotic * Testosterone * Caffeine * Vitamins ===Reputation=== Many of Hitler's other close friends did not like Morell. For example, Herman Goring, the Vice-Chancellor of Germany, called Morell Der Reichsspritzenmeister ("Injection Master of the German Reich") and "The Master of the Imperial Needle." Both nicknames meant the same thing: that Morell used injections (shots of medicine) to fix every problem. Morell often argued with Dr. Karl Brandt, who had been Hitler's personal doctor since 1933. Eva Braun, Hitler's girlfriend, called Morell's office a "pig sty" and refused to see him. ==Prison and death== On 20 April 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, Hitler was hiding in his bunker in Berlin with Morell and some of his other personal workers. Hitler told Morell and some other workers to fly from Berlin to the Obersalzberg (Hitler's home in the mountains). Morell flew out of Berlin on 23 April. Morell was soon caught by the Americans. He was interrogated on 18 May 1945. He was kept in jail in an American prison camp, in the same place that the Nazi concentration camp called Buchenwald used to be. However, he was never charged with a crime. Morell died on 26 May 1948, in a hospital in Bavaria, Germany. He was very obese and had many health problems when he died. ==Related pages== * Adolf Hitler * Nazi Germany * World War II ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1948 deaths Category:German doctors Category:Nazis

Woman on top
Woman on top (also called cowgirl or riding position) is a group of sex positions in which the man lies back or sits. The woman straddles him facing either forward or backward. The man then inserts his erect penis into the woman's vagina or anus. The cowgirl name comes from the image of the receiving partner "riding" the other partner the same way a cowboy rides a bucking horse. The position is often cited as one of the more popular sex positions, mostly by women. ==Gallery== File:Wiki-cowgirl.png|A couple engaged in sexual intercourse in the cowgirl position File:Paul Avril - Les Sonnetts Luxurieux (1892) de Pietro Aretino, 4.jpg|Edouard-Henri Avril - Les Sonnetts Luxurieux (1892) - depiction of reverse cowgirl position File:Carracci Angelique et Medor.jpg|Agostino Carracci (1557 - 1602), Angelique et Medor, two characters from the opera Roland File:Michael Zichy-love1.jpg|Depiction of reverse cowgirl position by Mihaly Zichy (c. 1911) ==References== Category:Sexual acts

Contraband
The word contraband (Old French contrebande "a smuggling") means any item which is illegal to be possessed or sold. The term is used for goods such as: * smuggled goods * stolen goods - knowingly dealing in stolen goods is an offense in itself, called fencing * the fruits of fraud, forgery etc. ==Law of armed conflict== In international law, contraband means goods sent to territories under the control of the enemy that can be used in armed conflict.'San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea', International Committee of the Red Cross (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 148 Traditionally, contraband is classified into two categories, absolute contraband and conditional contraband. Absolute contraband includes arms, munitions, and various materials. These can include chemicals and certain types of machinery that may be used to wage war. Conditional contraband includes food and livestock feed. Cargo of this kind, while presumably innocent in character, can be seized if the supplies are destined for the armed forces of the enemy. Under conditions of modern warfare almost everything can be called absolute contraband. == American Civil War == During the American Civil War, slaves who sought refuge in Union army military camps or who lived in territories that fell under Union control were declared contraband. This policy was first used by General Benjamin F. Butler in 1861, in what came to be known as the "Fort Monroe Doctrine," established in Hampton, Virginia. By war's end, the Union had set up 100 contraband camps in the Southern United States. The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony (1863-1867) was developed to be a colony."The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony", provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010 Many adult former slaves worked for wages for the Army at such camps. == References == Category:Legal terms Category:International law
Mystery shopper
Mystery shopping (or mystery customer) is a management tool used to find out how customers are being treated. Retail companies use it to get an idea about how their branches are being managed and operated. Also franchise chains use it to make sure franchisees are keeping to the agreements made with the parent company. The idea is to get information which is otherwise hard to obtain. Quality of service, or compliance with regulations and/or agreements are what is often investigated. A company hires a person to be a customer. The company being evaluated does not know who the mystery shopper is. Mystery shoppers perform specific tasks such as buying a product, asking questions, registering complaints or behaving in a certain way. Afterwards, they provide detailed reports or feedback about their experiences. Category:Commerce
Australian Kelpie
The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheepdog. The word 'Kelpie' is Gaelic and means "water sprite". They are very successful at herding and driving livestock with little or no guidance. The Kelpie is a medium-sized dog. They come in both the tan markings and solid colors. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used mainly to herd sheep, cattle and goats. == Characteristics == The Kelpie can do the work of several men. They are tireless workers and can work all day in the hottest climates. Kelpies are able to travel more than in a single day. Like the Border Collie the Kelpie is an intimidator. It locks eyes with an animal to get it to move. Unlike the Border Collie, the Kelpie also nips at the heels of herd animals to get and keep them moving. A typical Kelpie weighs from 25 to 45 pounds. They have a life expectancy of from 10 to 14 years on average. Kelpies have natural oils in their skin that keeps their coat weather resistant. For that reason they should be bathed only when absolutely necessary to avoid drying out their skin. An occasional rubdown with a towel keeps them clean. == Types == The breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie. The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for working ability rather than appearance. == References == Category:Dog breeds Category:Working dogs Kelpie
Tajdid
Tajdid () is an Arabic word that means "renewal". It is usually put together with din to mean "renewal of the religion." A similar but less common expression is ihya' al-din (), which may be translated as "revival of the religion." The purpose of the tajdid (renewal or revival) is to implement this ideal model in Muslims' lives, wherever and whenever Muslim society exists. This purpose implies that tajdid is a continuous effort by Muslims always to explain Islam and make it applicable in continually changing situations without violating its principles. The notion of tajdid in the Islamic tradition can be traced back to the Prophet Muhammad, who said that "At the start of each century there will arise in this ummah (the Muslim community) those who will call for a religious renewal". Such people (mujaddids, or renewers of Islam), are believed to always come in the time when Muslim community departs from the true path defined by the Qur'an and sunnah (example of the Prophet). The task of the mujaddid, therefore, is to return Muslims to their basic sources (the Qur'an and sunnah), to clean Islam from all un-Godly elements, to present Islam and make it flourish more or less in its original pure form and spirit. The tradition of a renewal of the faith went back to Islam's first century, with the caliph Umar II ('Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz), who came to power in the Muslim year 99 and was particularly revered for his piety, in contrast to his predecessors. He was viewed as a renewer of the faith in an age of increasingly profane rule, and later mujaddids and their movements in various parts of the Islamic world followed his precedent. == References == * A Quest For True Islam: A Study of the Islamic Resurgence Movement among the Youth in Bandung, Indonesia by Rifki Rosyad.

Missionaries of Charity
thumb|right|200px| Missionaries of Charity (MC) is a Roman Catholic Latin rite congregation started on 7 October in 1950. It was founded by Mother Teresa. It started in the slums of Kolkata (Calcutta, India) with Mother Teresa and 12 sisters. It now has a membership of nearly 5,000 sisters worldwide. Members of the religious order show they belong to this group using the order's initials, "M.C." A sister who belongs to MC must follow their vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. There is also a fourth vow, to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor." Malcolm Muggeridge, Something Beautiful for God (New York: Harper & Row, 1986), pp. 105, 113 MC members all wear the same white and blue habit that Mother Teresa wore. == From one to three stripes == In 1948 Mother Teresa changed her Sisters of Loreto habit to a simple cotton white sari with one blue stripe. Blue is the color of the Virgin Mary. The sari covered an all white habit. She (and later, her sisters of charity) wore the habit for over ten years. But parents of several Bengali sisters pointed out that the sari with one blue stripe was also worn by poor women who swept the streets of Calcutta. Mother Teresa and her sisters officially adopted the three blue stripes in 1960. == References == == Other websites == * Volunteering with the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata * Missionaries of Charity Fathers (started by Mother Teresa) Category:Roman Catholic religious orders Category:Kolkata Category:1950 establishments in India

Carotenoid
Carotenoids (or tetraterpenoids) are organic pigments. They are found in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants, and also some bacteria and fungi. The only animals known to produce carotenoids are aphids and mites, which got the genes from fungi. There are over 600 known carotenoids. They are of two types, xanthophylls (which contain oxygen) and carotenes (which are purely hydrocarbons with no oxygen). Carotenoids have two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis, and they protect chlorophyll from photodamage. Beta-carotene is the most common form in plants. Some carotenoids (like ?-carotene) have vitamin A activity (so they can convert to retinol). These and other carotenoids can also act as antioxidants. In the eye, certain other carotenoids (lutein, astaxanthin, and zeaxanthin) apparently act directly to absorb damaging blue and near-ultraviolet light. This protects the macula of the retina, the part of the eye with the sharpest vision. == References == Category:Hydrocarbons Category:Pigments Category:Horizontal gene transfer
